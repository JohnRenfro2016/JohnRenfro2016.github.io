<h1>The Legends of Coyote</h1>
 <p>These stories were passed down from the Rainbow Light Sky Gods to 
Ren on the Salt River Reservation of Phoenix, Arizona in the Summer of 
1996. 

<h2>Coyote Man Loses His Beautiful Fur</h2>
 <div class="columns">
 <p class="p2">Coyote Man was on his way to get married when off the 
trail he saw several young men from a neighboring village engaging in 
high stakes gambling. Coyote Man had fun gambling with them and hoped to
 win many of the items to impress his new bride. It was getting late and
 Coyote Man had lost the money for the honeymoon. The neighbors said, 
"Hey, we know you have nothing left. If you want to win your money back,
 gamble your beautiful coat." Coyote Man had the most beautiful coat of 
all the ancient ones. He was in a hurry, so he consented. Well, Coyote 
Man left the game naked and went to the wedding ceremony. No one was 
there except Badger Woman, Elk Woman, and Crow Woman. "Your bride left 
with her party very angry." The three women took pity on him. "We have 
nothing but old winter coats to clothe you with." Coyote Man accepted 
their hospitality and told them that he would never gamble what he could
 not afford to lose, again. He began to brush out his coat. "I will live
 with you women and help you gather food and wood for the winter. No one
 else loves me or will forgive my foolishness."

<h2>Coyote in Eden</h2>
  <p class="p2">God created all things in an idealistic way. God created
 Earth. God's brother, Coyote, walked up next to him on Earth. "Looks 
good, God." God created all of the plants, and animals. "Looks good, 
God." After a week, God got tired and decided to create another world. 
God was bored, so he left. Coyote stayed. Coyote noticed that Earth was 
boring. The land had no beautiful mountains or hills. It was flat. There
 were no waves. The sea was still. Every tree and plant grew in military
 rows. They gave only oranges and carrots. All of the animals were dumb,
 and there were none such as he and his brother, God. There was nothing 
to challenge these dumb animals because everything was perfect. They 
stayed the same. Coyote got an idea. I will fix it. Coyote stomped on 
the ground and made the mountains and hills. Coyote splashed in the 
water and created falls, waves, and rain. Coyote threw the seeds of all 
the plants into the sky so that they would mix together. And Coyote made
 the animals fight and die. He created humans. These humans became smart
 and soon discovered Coyote. They blamed him for earthquakes, floods, 
brush fires, and tornados. They said he was bad. God came back to see 
Earth again. "What have you done Coyote?" Coyote smiled. 

<h2>Coyote Steals Fire</h2>
  <p class="p2">Back then, only God knew how to make fire. He would sit 
in the grey clouds and throw lightning down and burn things. Humans were
 scared of him and stayed away from his fire. Fire hurt. One evening, 
God sent down a bolt and set Coyote's tail on fire. "Damn you, God. I 
hate your jokes." Coyote wanted to get him back. He created a mound of 
dry sticks that looked just like a dog. The biggest stick looked like 
his tail. God looked down from way up. He laughed and threw a bolt. The 
entire stack of dog-looking sticks caught on fire. "Oh, no. I killed 
Coyote!" Coyote waited for God to leave. Coyote Man took the stick that 
looked like the tail and brought it to human's camp. "Take this fire and
 heal or kill each other with it. I don't care. God does not want you to
 have it. This is my revenge." The woman took the fire and thanked 
Coyote Man. God saw fire in human's camp and they were not burning to 
death. "Coyote!" God screamed. He has been trying to kill Coyote every 
since. Coyote laughed. 

<h2>Coyote Meets the Scarecrow</h2>
  <p class="p2">Coyote was trotting through the forest looking for his 
friend Crow. "Crow, Crow, Crow, where are you? I am hungry. I need you 
to show me where I can get something to eat." Scarecrow yelled at 
Coyote. "Hey, your friend Crow is dead." Coyote peeked out at the 
Scarecrow in the clearing at the end of the woods. Coyote spoke. "Did 
you kill her?" Scarecrow said, "No, Farmer shot her with a gun. I just 
hang here and do what Farmer tells me to do. I threatened Crow with hell
 fire, when she came in here to steal corn. But I did not kill her." 
Coyote smirked. "I am hungry. Will you threaten me with hell fire if I 
take some corn?" Scarecrow said, "yes." Coyote got mad and immediately 
attacked Scarecrow and tore him down. Farmer shot Coyote in the foot. 
Coyote limped off and survived. "I know now, not to blame Scarecrow for 
the death of my friend and my own pain." Coyote pressed legal charges of
 murder, assault, and religious fraud, against Farmer and won ten 
million dollars in damages. Farmer was executed. Scarecrow could not 
scare away any of Crow's brothers and sisters because Farmer was not 
there to put words in the puppet's mouth. The world became a better 
place.
