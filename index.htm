This is stuff that helped me. Maybe it will help you. I have taken so much. I just want to give a little back.
<ul>
<p>-Floss and brush your teeth and tongue before you go to bed.
<p>-Go to bed early regular hours, even on your days off. Try to sleep as much as you can and wake up naturally before your alarm. Your mind and body need repair and your subconscious often tries to decide for you how much sleep you need.
<p>-Make your bed every day which puts you in a frame of mind where you work towards completing things.
<p>-Exercise at least 30 minutes per day.
<p>-Play a musical instrument at least 30 minutes a day which will exercise your mind. Sherlock Holmes did.
<p>-Read a chapter from a book per day.
<p>-Don't focus on what not to eat but eat at least a small bag of frozen vegetables per day or a salad.
<p>-Don't depend on anyone or anything for your happiness. They will let you down. Depend on yourself to be happy.
<p>-Every cringe thing, bad thing that has happened to you is a valuable learning experience and makes you who you are today.
<p>-We all die. Death is not the end.
<p>-Anthony Robbins "Unlimited Power" (life management)
<p>-Ellen Kreidman "Light Her Fire" (relationships)
<p>-Stephen R. Covey "7 Habits of Highly Effective People" (work)
<p>-Keith Harary Ph.D., Pamela Weintraub "Lucid Dreams in 30 Days" (enlightenment)
