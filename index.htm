<h2>Original Content Here</h2>
<div class="HeaderStyle"><a href='JapaneseEnglish.htm' target='blank'>Studying Japanese Language</a></div> This is probably the largest Japanese to English dictionary on the Internet and you can download the HTML page and use it offline.

<div class="HeaderStyle"><a href='RussianEnglish.htm' target='blank'>Studying Russian Language</a></div> This is the latest Russian to English parser and I'm mostly just deciding how to display the grammar.

<div class="HeaderStyle">My <a href='https://archive.org/details/fav-johnrenfro' target='blank'>Archive</a></div> We should preserve the history of our written publications. Hard copies need to be held in physical archive locations. Analog devices such as typewriters will come in handy if the world's electronics are fried. Source: Fallout 4

<div class="HeaderStyle">My <a href='https://www.pinterest.jp/johnrenfro2016/' target='blank'>Pinterest</a></div> It's impractical to keep all this junk but someday we'll be able to 3D print this junk for our children's children. Images of the junk are needed. This is my favorite junk when I was alive. ~KamalaSpeak

<div class="HeaderStyle">My <a href='https://twitter.com/JohnRenfro2016' target='blank'>Twitter</a> </div> This is where I rant to strangers about stupid stuff or political stuff. I mostly ramble on about my ethnic heritage or about my conservative yet 1980s moderate liberal views. This way, I mumble less to the people in my life. I am a complainer.

<h2>Killing Time</h2>
Books: "Smart Women" by Judy Blume - I've been reading this forever. But I am slowly getting to the end.<p> 
Food: English Muffins from scratch - It's just a pancake with thicker sticky dough.<p>
Games: PS4(2015) "Fallout 4" playing on PS5 - This has a lot of bugs that don't crash the game. You have to figure out how to play it over time. I never bother with the 'Help'.<p>
Guitar: "Faking my own Death" by Allison Ponthier<p> - I picked up guitar again during Corona and I've been staying with it. 
Movies: "Extraction" 1 and 2 - fairly violent and well written<p>
TV Shows: "The Goldbergs" Season 5 - I always watch TV shows way after because I live in Japan am not offered streaming U.S. TV or U.S. Hulu. I do have NetFlix, Disney+ and Hulu Japan.<p>
