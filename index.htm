Early civilization cut down public fruit trees so that armies would fight and die to be fed from the establishment's private fruit trees. This is how it all works.

The Mesopotamian Empire Hyksos not only conquered Egypt but occupied the entire world by hugging the coasts. This is why all the pyramids are similar.

There will be no self-driving flying cars in the future because machines break or get hacked and some people are terrible drivers. The future will be child-proofed to avoid lawsuits. Auto-drive will be used for safety only and possibly drive a victim to the hospital.

Computers will most likely never be glasses or contacts as obstructing your field of vision can cause accidents when traveling in public.

However, there will be military Rocket Men.

Robots will replace all manual labor soon. This means that people in the future will be poor communal farmers or live in a U.S. military style system where they are paid to train and given food, housing and benefits.
<p>
Large office buildings and human run factories will disappear as groups of people are no longer needed to run offices or work in factories. However, Large building University Towns/Military Bases will rise up everywhere.
