Don't ask me and I won't tell you that I'm completely insane. I should be on disability. The paranormal exists because it is a miracle that I'm not locked away. Am I a danger to myself and others? No. Should I be on medication? Yes. Please legalize Marijuana. I'm not being *flippant. It really does help with my disorders.
<p>
*flippant definition: not serious
