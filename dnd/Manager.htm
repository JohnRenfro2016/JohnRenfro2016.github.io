in a 70 foot x 50 foot x 20 foot high room with many exits. Standing in a semicircle around the slide are 10 gnolls, aiming crossbows and armed with longswords. They fire their

The spell cannot be cast upon living creatures. Antipathy:This dweomer causes the affected creature or alignment type to feel an overpowering urge to leave the area or not touch the affected item. If a saving throw versus magic is successful,the creature may stay/touch the item,but the creature will feel very uncomfortable,and a persistent itching will cause it to suffer the loss of 1 point of dexterity per round the area or item is remained in or touched,subject to o maximum of 4 points. Failure to save versus magic forces the creature/alignment type to abandon the magicked area or item,shunning it permanently and never willingly enter/touch it until the spell is removed or expires. The material component for this application of the spell is a lump of alum soaked in vinegar. Sympathy:By casting the sympathy application of the spell,the magic-user can cause a particular type of creature or alignment of character to feel elated and pleased to be in an crea or with the prospect of touching or possessing an object or item. The desire to stay in the area or touch/possess the magicked object/item will be overpowering,and unless a saving throw versus magic is made,the creature or character will stay or refuse to release the object. If the saving throw is successful,the creature or character is released from the enchantment,but a subsequent saving throw must be made from 1-6 turns later,and if this one fails,the affected creature will return to the area or object. The material components of this spell are 1,000 g.p. worth of crushed pearls and a drop of honey.

The volume of sound caused,however,is directly related to the level of the spell caster,The relative noise is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast,3rd level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of 4 men,maximum. Each additional experience level adds a like volume,so at 4th level the magic-user can have the spell cause sound equal to that of 8 men,maximum,Thus,talking,singing,or shouting,and/or walking,marching or running sounds can be caused,The auditory illusion created by an audible glomer spell can be virtually any type of sound,but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the magic-user casting the spell. A horde of rats running ond squeaking is about the same volume as 8 men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men,while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men. if a character states that he or she does not believe the sound,o saving throw is made,and if it succeeds,the character then hears nothing,or possibly just a faint sound.

ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS,MONSTER MANU- AL,Blink Dog.)The segment of the round that the spell caster “blinks out feet is determined by random roll with 2d4,and during this same segment he or she will appear again 2 feet distant from his or her previous position.(Direction is determined by roll of d8:1 = right ahead,2 = right,3 = right behind,4 = behind,5 = left behind,6 = left,7 = left ahead,8 = ahead.)If some object is already occupying the space where the spell caster is indicated as “blinking inches into,his or her form is displaced in a direction away from original(round starting)position for any distance necessary to appear in empty space,but never in excess of an additional 10 feet .

function Cacodemon(){a="Cacodemon (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:7 Components:V,S,M Range:1 inches Casting Time:Special Duration:Special Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:Creature summoned Explanation/Description:This perilous exercise in dweomercroeft summons up a powerful demon of type IV,V,or VI,depending upon the demon feet s name being known to the magic-user. Note that this spell is not of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power,and lesser sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any event,the spell caster must know the name of the type IV,V,or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies,the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of protection(or a thaumaturgic triangle with protection from evil)and the demon confined within a pentagram(circled pentacle)if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows:1)The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a spiritwrack spell ,allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service,and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous,as o minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore,the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience,so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable. 2)By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more humon sacrifices,the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again,the spell caster is well advised to hove ample protection and power to defend himself or herself,as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient — or it is easier to enjoy the summoner feet s slow death — and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge,as his name is known,he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement,not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand,only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain,and the summoned cacodemon might be favorably disposed towards such a character,especially if he or she is also chaotic. 3)The summoned demon can be the object of a trap the sou! spell ,In this case,the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon feet s services,although the cacodemon might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken,for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped,the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him,and this requires one service from the now loosed monster. If the individual(s)freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the mon- ster asks what is required of him,the demon is under no con- straint not to slay the liberator(s)on the spot,but if a service is required,the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss. The duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform,or is impossible to perform,is 50% likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected,for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days. The demon summoned will be exceptionally strong,i.e. 8 hit points per hit die. Casting time is | hour per type(numeric)of the demon to be summoned,If there is any interruption during this period,the spell fails. If there is an interruption while the cacodemon is summoned,it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attock the magic-user,this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption. Each demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6(2d10 with respect to type Vi demons),that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs,it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct,so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon. The components of this spell are 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur,bat hairs,lard,soot,mercuric- nitric acid crystals,mandrake root,alcohol,and a piece of parchment with the demon feet s name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal(preferably a human,of course)placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held.",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

If the magic-user continues downward beyond 5 feet ,there is a chance that the pit will collapse:15%/additional 5° in depth in earth,35%/additional 5 feet depth in sand,and 55%/additional 5 feet depth in mud. Any creature at the edge(1°)of such a pit uses its dexterity score as a saving throw to avoid falling into the hole,with a score equal to or less than the dexterity meaning that a fall was avoided. Any creature moving rapidly towards a pit area will fall in unless it saves versus magic. Any creature caught in the center of o pit just dug will always fall in. The spell caster uses a miniature shovel and tiny bucket to activate a dig spell and must continue to hold these material components while each pit is excavated.

function DrawmijsInstantSummons(){a="DrawmijsInstantSummons (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:7 Components:V,S,M Range:Infinite + special Casting Time:1 segment Duration:Instantaneous Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:One small object Explanation/Description:When this spell is cast,the magic-user teleports some desired item from virtually any location directly to his or her hand. The object must be singular,can be no larger than a sword is long,have no more mass and weight than a shield(about 75 g.p. weight),and it must be non-living. To prepare this spell,the magic-user must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 g.p. value in his or her hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. He or she then must have this same gem available to cost the spell. All that is then required is that the magic-user utter the final word while crushing the gem,and the desired item is transported instantly into the spell caster feet s right or left hand as he or she desires. The item must,of course,have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named,and only that particular item will be summoned by the spell. If the item is in the possession of another creature,the spell will not work,but the caster will know who the possessor is and roughly where he,she,or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence,but only if such items are not in the possession(not necessarily physical grasp)of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th,the magic-user is able to summon a desired item from 1 plane further removed from the plane he or she is upon at the time the spell is cast,i.e. 1 plane at 14th level,but 2 at 15th,3 at 16th,etc. Thus,a magic-user of 16th level could effect the spell even if the item desired was on the second layer of one of the outer planes,but at 14th level the magic-user would be able to summon the item only if it were on one of the Elemental Plones or the Astral or the Ethereal Plane.

function DuoDimensions(){a="DuoDimensions(Alteration)Level:7 Components:V,S,M Range:0 Casting Time:7 segments Duration:3 rounds +1 Saving Throw:None round/level Area of Effect:Personal Explanation/Description:A duo-dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions,height and width but no depth. He or she is thus invisible when a sideways turn is made,and this invisibility can only be detected by means of a true seeing spell or similar means. In addition,the duo-dimensional magic-user can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as they have the proper height according to his or her actual length — going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The magic-user can perform all actions on a normal basis. He or she can turn and become invisible,move in this state,and appear again next round and cast a spell,disappearing on the following round. Note that when turned the magic-user cannot be affected by any form of attack,but when visible he or she is subject to triple the amount of damage normal for an attack form,i.e. a dagger thrust would inflict 3-12 hit points of damage if it struck a duo-dimensional magic-user. Furthermore,the magic-user has a portion of his or her existence on the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect,and he or she is subject to possible notice from creatures thereupon. If noticed,it is 25% probable that the magic-user will be entirely brought to the Astral Plane by attack from the astral creature. The material components of this spell are a thin,flat ivory likeness of the spell caster(which must be of finest workmanship,gold filigreed,and enameled and gem-studded at an average cost of 5,000 to 10,000 g.p.)and a strip of parchment.

Area of Effect:One item Explanation/Description:This is a spell which must be used by a magic- user planning to create a magic item. The enchant an item spell prepares the object to accept the magic to be placed upon or within it. The item to be magicked must meet the following tests:1)it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2)the item must be the finest possible,considering its nature,i.e. crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3)its cost or value must reflect the second test,and in most cases the item must have a raw materials cost in excess of 100 g.p. With respect to requirement 3),it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes,leather goods,cloth,and pottery not normally embroidered,bejeweled,tooled,carved,and/or engraved; however,if such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions,these are required for the item to be magicked. Sie be | es — 2 = inches re | KK / oo Hy S(O ie erases 3 < A cA\,= xT sis ri =i \* rh M4 j re ly —i—,‘ 4 y y inches i P,aS,ae The item to be prepared must be touched manually by the spell caster,This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time which isa base 16 hours plus an additional 8-64 hours(as the magic-user may never work over 8 hours per day,and haste or any other spells will not alter time required in any way,this effectively means that casting time for this spell is 2 days + 1-8 days). All work must be uninterrupted,and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 feet distant from the spell caster,for if it is,the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again.(Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic may be performed,and the magic-user must remain quiet and in isolation.)At the end of the spell,the caster will “know inches that the item is ready for the final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable,and if the item makes a saving throw(which is exactly the some as thot of the magic-user who magicked it)versus magic,the spell is completed.(Note that the spell caster feet s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item,up to but not exceeding +3.)A result of 1 on the die(d20)always results in failure,regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished,the magic-user may begin to place the desired dweomer upon the item,and the spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades,and the item must again be enchanted. Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 4 hours + 4-8 additional hours per spel! level of the magic being cast. Again,during casting the item must be touched by the magic- user,and during rest periods it must always be within 1° of his or her person,This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item,and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last,even if any prior spell failed. No magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch,and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. It is also necessary to point out that while it is possible to tell when the basic(enchant an item)spell succeeds,it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take,for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally,items that are charged — rods,staves,wands,javelins of lightning,ring of wishes,etc. — can never be made permanent. Scrolls or magic devices can never be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared. The material component(s)for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being magicked and successive magicks to be cast upon it. For example,a cloak of displacement might require the hides of | or more displacer beasts,a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s)of dragon(s)it will be effective against,and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin.

Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object. Enlargement causes increase in both size and weight. It can be cast upon only a single creature or object. Spell range is 2 feet for each level of experience of the magic-user,and its duration is 1 turn per level of experience of the spell caster. The effect of the enlargement spell is to increase the size of a living creature(or a symbiotic or community entity)by 20% per level of experience of the magic-user,with a maximum additional growth of 200%. The effect on objects is one-half that of creatures,i.e. 10% per level to a 100% maximum additional enlargement. The creature or object must be seen in order to effect the spell. The maximum volume of living material which can be initially affected is 10 cubic feet — for non-living matter,5 cubic feet — per level of the magic- user. While magical properties are not increased by this spell — a huge +1 sword is still only +1,a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions,a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate,etc. — weight,mass and strength are. Thus,a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective; a hurled stone would have more mass(and be more hurtful providing enlargement took place just prior to impact); chains would be more massive; doors thicker; a thin line turned to a sizable,longer rope; and so on. Likewise,a person 12 feet tall would be as an ogre,while an 18 feet tall person would actually be a giant for the duration of the spell. The reverse spell,reduce,will negate the effects or actually make creatures or objects smaller in the same ratios as the regular spell application functions. Unwilling victims of the spell,or its reverse,are entitled to a saving throw,which,if successful,indicates the magic does not function,and the spell is wasted,The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron, ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

However,the magic-user has no control over what sort of creature will answer the summoning,or if any at all will come,and the power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. At such time as the magic-user determines to find a familiar,he or she must stoke up a brass brazier with charcoal,and when this is burning well,add 100 g.p. worth of incense,herbs(basil,savory,and catnip for sure),and fat. When these items are burning,the spell caster begins his or her incantation,and it must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. Your referee will secretly determine all results. The magic-user has absolutely no control over what sort of a creature Gppears to become his or her familiar.

Each is abnormally intelligent and totally faithful to the magic-user whose familiar it becomes. The number of the familiar feet s hit points is added to the hit point total of the magic-user when it is within 12 inches of its master,but if the familiar should ever be killed,the magic-user will permanently lose double that number of hit points.

The spell causes the geased creature to follow the instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1 to 4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes corresponding loss of strength points until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a wish spell,but a dispel magic or remove curse will not negate it.

One magic-user can have but one pair of these chests at any given time,and even wish spells will not allow exception! While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica,the caster chants the spell. This will cause the large chest to vanish into the ethereal plone,The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the magic-user no matter what its apparent size.

The lightning bolt will set fire to combustibles,sunder wooden doors,splinter up to 1 feet thickness of stone,and melt metals with a low melting point(lead,gold,copper,silver,bronze). Saving throws must be made for objects which withstand the full force of a stroke(cf. fireball),The area of the lightning bolt feet s effect is determined by the spell caster,just as its distance is. The stroke can be either a forking bolt 1 inches wide and 4 inches long,or a single bolt 2 inches wide and 8 inches long. If a 12th level magic-user cast the spell at its maximum range,16 inches in this case,the stroke would begin at 16 inches and flash outward from there,as a forked bolt ending at 20 inches or a single one ending at 24 inches . if the full length of the stroke is not possible due to the interposition of a non- conducting barrier(such as a stone wall),the lightning bolt will double and rebound towards its coster,its length being the normal total from beginning to end of stroke,damage caused to interposing barriers notwithstanding. Example:An 8 inches stroke is begun at o range of 4 inches ,but the possible space in the desired direction is only 3 feet 4 inches ; so the bolt begins at the 3 feet 4 inches maximum,and it rebounds 8 inches in the direction of its creator.

The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the magic-user feet s body at the time of spell casting. Possession takes place only if the victim fails to make the required saving throw. Failure to possess a victim leaves the life force of the magic-user in the magic jor. Possession attempts require 1 round each,If the body of the spell caster is destroyed,the life force in the magic jor is not harmed. If the magic jar is destroyed,the life force is snuffed out. Returning to the real body requires 1 round,and can only be done froma magic jar in spell range of the body. The saving throw versus a magic jar spell is modified by comparing combined intelligence and wisdom scores(intelligence only in non-human or non-humanoid creatures)of the magic-user and victim. Difference Die Adjustment Negative 9 or + +4 Negative 8 to 6 +3 Negative 5 to3 +2 Negative 2 to0 +1 Positive 1 to 4 0 Positive 510 8 “l Positive 9 to 12 -2 Positive 13 or + -3 A negotive score indicates the magic-user has a lower score than does his or her intended victim; thus,the victim has a saving throw bonus. The magic jar is the spell feet s material component. Note that a possessed creature with any negative difference or a positive difference less than 5 is entitled to a saving throw each round to determine if it is able to displace the possessor feet s mind,a positive difference of 5 to 8 gains a saving throw each turn,a positive difference of 9 to 12 gains a saving throw each day,anda positive difference of 13 or better gains a saving throw each week. If the magic jorred creature regains control of its mind,the magic-user is trapped until he or she can take over the mind for control or escape.

The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of the caster,The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from the caster feet s hand to a distance of 1 inches per level of the magic- user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of the caster upon the creature struck,with a saving throw versus magic applicable,and all damage negated if it is successful(as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed),but the path of the ray being plotted to its full distance,as anything else in its path must save(if applicable)or toke appropriate damage. Finally,Otiluke feet s Freezing Sphere can be cost so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone,cool to the touch,but not harmful. This globe can be cast,and it will shatter upon impact,inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10° radius(one- half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal to | round times the level of the spell caster,it automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers,although it can also prove hazardous to the spell caster and/or his or her associates as well,The material components of the spell depend upon in which form it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for the first application of the spell,a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell,and a 1,000 g-p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell.

function PolymorphAnyObject(){a="PolymorphAnyObject (Alteration)Level:8 Components:V,S,M Range:4 inches feet per level Casting Time:1 round Duration:Variable Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:Speciol Explanation/Description:This spell changes one object(living or otherwise)into another. When used as a polymorph other or stone to flesh,simply treat the spell as a more powerful version,with saving throws made at -4 on the die. When it is cast in order to change other objects,the duration of the spell will depend on how radically removed the original was from its magicked state,as well as how different in size. This will be determined by your Dungeon Master by comparing:kingdom — animal,vegetable,mineral class — mammals,bipeds,fungi,metals,spheres,etc. relationship — twig is to tree,sand is to beach,etc. size — smaller,equal,larger shape — comparative resemblance of the original to the polymorphed state intelligence — particularly with regard to a change in which the end product is more intelligent Change in kingdom makes the spell work for hours or turns,i.e. hours if one removed,turns if two removed. Other changes likewise affect spell duration. Thus,changing a lion to an androsphinx would be permanent,but turning a turnip to a purple worm would be ao change of only hours duration; turning a tusk into an elephant would be permanent,but turning @ twig into o sword would be only a change of several turns duration. All polymorphed objects radiate a strong magic,and if a dispel magic spell is used upon them,they will return to their natural form. Note that a stone to flesh,or its reverse,will affect objects under this spell. The material components of this spell are mercury,gum arabic,and smoke.

function PolymorphOther(){a="PolymorphOther (Alteration)Level:4 Components:V,S,M Range:4 inches feet per level Casting Time:4 segments Duration:Permanent Saving Throw:Neg. Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic which completely alters the form and ability,and possibly the personality and mentality,of the recipient. Of course,creatures with a lower intelligence cannot be polymorphed into something with a higher intelligence,but the reverse is possible. The creature polymorphed must make a “‘system shock inches(cf. CONSTITUTION)roll to see if it survives the change. If it is successful,it then acquires all of the form and abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into. There is a base 100% chance that this change will also change its personality and mentality into that of the creature whose form it now possesses. For each | point of intelligence of the creature polymorphed,subtract 5% from the base chance. Additionally,for every hit die of difference between the original form and the form it is changed into by the spell,the polymorphed creature must adjust the base chance percentage by +/-5% per hit die below or above its own number(or level in the case of characters). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form must be checked daily until the change takes place,(Note that all creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!)If a one hit die orc of 8 intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 hit dice,for example,it is 85%(100% - [5% X 8 intelligence1 + [(6-1)X 5%1 = 85%)likely to actually become one in all respects,but in any case it will have the dragon feet s physical and mental capabilities; and if it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon,it will know what it formerly knew as well. Another example:an 8th level fighter successfully polymorphed into a blue dragon would know combat with weapons and be able to employ them with prehensile dragon forepaws if the fighter did not take on dragon personality and mentality. However,the new form of the polymorphed creature may be stronger than it looks,i.e. a mummy changed to a puppy dog would be very tough,or a brontosaurus changed to an ant would be impossible to squash merely from being stepped on by a small creature or even a man-sized one. The magic-user must use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form,and this too requires a “system shock inches saving throw.

The spell does nor give the other abilities(attack,magic,etc.),nor does it run the risk of changing personality and mentality. No “system shock inches check is required. Thus,a magic-user changed to an owl could fly,but his or her vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings,but not the pudding feet s offensive or defensive capabilities. Naturally,the strength of the new form must be sufficient to allow normal movement. The spell caster can change his or her form as often as desired,the change requiring only 5 segments. Damage to the polymorphed form is computed as if it were inflicted upon the magic-user,but when the mogic-user returns to his or her own form,from | to 12(d12)points of damage are restored.

To determine this,roll the appropriate hit dice and multiply by .20,any score less than .4 is dropped — in the case of monsters with one (or fewer) hit dice,this indicates the monster was not successfully created — and scores of .4 or greater are rounded up to one hit point. If the creature or creatures viewing the shadow monsters fail their saving throw and believe the illusion,the shadow monsters perform as normal with respect to armor class and attack forms. If the viewer or viewers make their saving throws,the shadow monsters are armor class 10 and do only 20% of normal melee damage (biting,clawing,weapon,etc.),dropping fractional damage less than .4 as done with hit points.

function Spiritwrack(){a="Spiritwrack (Evocation/Abjuration)Level:6 Components:V,M Range:1 inches + 1 feet per level Casting Time:Special Duration:Special Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:A spiritwrack spell is a very strong protection/punishment spell against the powerful creatures of the nether planes(Abyssal,Hades,Hell,etc.),but to employ the magic,the spell caster must know the name of the being at whom he or she will direct the energy. Prior to actual utterance of a spiritwrack spell the magic-user must prepare an illuminated sheet of vellum,carefully inscribed in special inks made from powdered rubies and the ichor of a slain demon of type |,Il,or Ill and covered with gold leaf in a continuous border. The spell caster must personally prepare this document,including the being feet s name thereon.(This will require from 8-32 hours of time and cost 1,000 g.p. for vellum,special pens,gold leaf,and other miscellaneous materials alone; the cost of the powdered rubies is a minimum of 5,000 g.p. for each document.)If the demon,devil,or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form(and not possessing another creature feet s body instead),the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation. Immediately upon beginning the reading of the document,the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage(adjusted for the level of the magic-user)as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made,the monster feels greatly uncomfortable,and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there,it is 90% likely to retreat to its own(or another)plane,as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round,with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation,the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading,the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points,horrible pain,and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane — there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document. Obviously,the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards,so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment.

The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast,Thereafter the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue,although a faint magic will be detected from the stone if it is checked for. Despite being in this condition,the petrified individual can see,hear,and smell normally. Feeling is only as acute as that which will actually affect the granite-hard substance of the individual feet s body,i.e. chipping is equal to a slight wound,but breaking off one of the statue feet s arms is another matter. The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to normal state in 1/6 of a segment,and then return to statue state in the same period if he or she so desires,as long as the spell duration is in effect. During the initial transformation from flesh to stone,the creature must make a saving throw of 82% or less,with -1 deducted from the dice roll score for each point of his or her constitution score,so an 18 constitution indicates certain success. Failure indicates system shock and resultant death. The material components of this spell are lime,sand,and a drop of water stirred by an iron bar such as a nail or spike.

For example,o stone weapon can be made,a special trapdoor fashioned,or an idol sculpted. By the same token,it would allow the spell caster to reshape a stone door,perhaps,so as to escape imprisonment,providing the volume of stone involved was within the limits of the area of effect.

Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:When this spell is cast by the magic-user,he or she influences the actions of the chosen recipient by utterance of a few words — phrases,or a sentence or two — suggesting a course of action desirable to the spell caster. The creature to be influenced must,of course,be able to understand the magic-user feet s suggestion,i.e.,it must be spoken in a language which the spell recipient understands. The suggestion must be worded in such o manner as to make the action sound reasonable; a request asking the creature to stab itself,throw itself onto a spear,immolate itself,or do some other obviously harmful act will automatically negate the effect of the spell. However,a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water,and a quick dip would be refreshing,is another matter; or the urging that o cessation of attack upon the magic-user feet s party would benefit a red dragon,for the group could loot a rich treasure elsewhere through co-operative action,is likewise a reasonable use of the spell feet s power. The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration,such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the recipient creature makes its saving throw,the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion will cause the saving throw to be made at a penalty(such as -1,-2,etc.)at the discretion of your Dungeon Master. Undead are not subject to suggestion.

The bickering lasts for 5-20 rounds; the fighting for 2-8 rounds. Feor — This symbo/ operates as an extra-strong fear spell,causing all creatures to save vs. the spell at -4 on the die or panic and flee os if affected by a fear spell . Hopelessness— All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save versus magic. Affected creatures will submit to the demands of any opponent,i.e. surrender,get out,etc.; the hopelessness lasts for 3 to 12(3d4)turns,and during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures will take no action during any round,and 25% likely that those taking action will turn back or retire from battle,as applicable.

Movement is 2 inches the first round,4 inches the second,8 inches the third,16 inches the fourth,and so on,doubling each round until a maximum telekinetic movement of 1,024 inches per round is reached.(Heavy objects travelling at high speed can be deadly weapons!)Note that telekinesis can be used to move opponents who fall within the weight capacity of the spell,but if they are able to employ as simple a counter-measure as an enlarge spell,for example(thus making the body weight go over the maximum spell limit),it is easily countered. Likewise,ambulation or some other form of motive power if the recipient of the spell is not able to ambulate,counters the effect of telekinesis,provided the velocity has not reached 16 inches per round.

Distance is not a factor,but inter-plane travel is not possible by means of a teleport spell. The spell caster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 2,500 g.p. equivalence,plus an additional 1,500 g.p. weight for each level of experience above the 10th,i.e. a 13th level magic-user teleports a maximum weight of 7,000 g.p.(700 pounds). If the destination area is very familiar to the magic-user(he or she has a clear mental picture through actual proximity to and studying of the area)it is unlikely that there will be any error in arriving exactly in the place desired. Lesser known areas(those seen only magically or from a distance)increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril. This is demonstrated below:Probability of Teleporting Destination Area Is High On Target Low Very familiar 01-02 | 03-99 00 Studied corefully 01-04 05-98 99-00 Seen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 Viewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 Never seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 Teleporting high means the magic-user will arrive 1 feet above ground for every 1% he or she is below the lowest “On Target inches probability — only 2 inches when the destination is very familiar,and as high as 32 inches if the destination area was never seen. Any low result means the instant death of the magic- user if the area into which he or she teleports to is solid,Note that there is no possibility of teleporting to an area of empty space,i.e. a substantial area of surface must be there,whether a wooden floor,a stone floor,natural ground,etc. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

The magic-user feet s hit points double,and all damage he or she sustains comes first from the magical points gained; so if damage does not exceed original hit points,none is actually taken,but if damage beyond the additional amount is sustained,each point counts as 2(double damage). The armor class of the magic-user is a full 4 factors better than that he or she possessed prior to casting the spell(AC 10 goes to 6,AC9 to 5,AC 8 to 4,etc.),all attacks are at a level equal to those of a fighter of the same level as the magic-user(i.e.,the spell caster uses the combat table normally restricted to fighters),and although he or she can employ a dagger only in attacking,damage inflicted by the weapon is at +2 additional hit points,and 2 such attacks per round are made by the magic-user. However,it is worth noting that this spell must run its full course,and the magic-user will continue attacking until all opponents are slain,he or she is killed,the magic is dispelled,or the Transformation duration expires.

Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:This spell is similar to the magic jar,except that the trap the sou! spell forces the subject creature feet s life force(and its material body,if any)into a special prison magicked by the spell caster. The subject of the spell must be seen by the caster,and the magic-user must know the subject feet s true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to the actual casting of the trap the soul,the magic-user must prepare the soul prison,a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience the creature whose sou! is to be trapped possesses,i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice(or 10th level)creature by placing an enchant an item spell upon it and then placing a maze spell into the gem,thereby forming the prison for the soul to be trapped. There are 2 manners in which the soul of the victim can be imprisoned. The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range,but this entitles it to exercise its magic resistance(if any)and a saving throw versus magic as well,and if the latter is successful,the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious,for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature feet s soul into the trap. If this method is used,it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A sympathy spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item,its soul is automatically transferred to the gem. The gem prison will hold the soul trapped until time indefinite,or until it is broken and the soul is released,allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane(and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plone of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane),it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise,the creature can go totally free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

Wooden objects above three inchesdiameter which are fixed firmly will not be affected,but loose objects(movable mantlets,siege towers,etc.)will move back,Objects under 3inches diameter which are fixed will splinter ond break and the pieces willmove with the wave of force.

The turn wood spelllasts for 4 rounds per level of experience of the druid casting it,and thewaves of force will continue to sweep down the set path for this period.The wooden objects in the Area of effect are pushed back at a rate of 4 inches per melee round.

function WeatherSummoning(){a="WeatherSummoning (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:6 Components:V,S,M Range:0 Casting Time:1 turn Duration:Special Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:The druidic weather summoning spell is similarto the contro! weather spell(q. v.)of clerical nature. By casting the spell,the druid calls forth weather commensurate with the climate and season ofthe area he or she is in at the time. Thus,in spring a tornado,thunderstorm,cold,sleet storm,or hot weather could be summoned. In summer atorrential rain,heat wave,hail storm,etc. can be called for. In autumn,hotor cold weather,fog,sleet,etc. could be summoned. Winter allows greatcold,blizzard,or thaw conditions to be summoned,Hurricane-force windscan be summoned near coastal regions in the late winter or early spring.The summoned weather is not under the control of the druid. It might lastbut a single turn in the case of a tornado,or for hours or even days in othercases. The Area of effect likewise varies from about | square mile to 100 ormore square miles. Note that several druids can act in concert to greatlyaffect weather,controlling winds and/or working jointly to summon veryextreme weather conditions. Within 4 turns after the spell is cast,the trendof the weather to come will be apparent,i.e.,clearing skies,gusts of warmor hot air,a chill breeze,overcast skies,etc. Summoned weather willarrive 6 to 17 turns(d12 + 5)after the spell is cast. Anything less thangreater mistletoe as the material component will sharply curtail theweather extremes desired.Seventh Level Spells: ",b="1d20+0",c="Detection",damageDice="1d8+0",getAction(t1)};
function Web(){a="Web (Evocation)Level:2 Components:V,S,M Range:4 inches feet per level Casting Time:2 segments Duration:2 turns/level Saving Throw:Neg. or 4 Areo of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:A web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong,sticky strands similar to spider webs,but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more points — floor and ceiling,opposite walls,etc. — diametrically opposed. The web spell covers a maximum area of 8 cubic inches,and the webs must be at least 1 inches thick,so a mass 4 inches high,2 inches wide,and 1 inches deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs,or simply touching them,become stuck amongst the gluey fibers. Creatures with less than 13 strength must remain fast until freed by another or until the spell wears off. For every full turn entrapped by a web,a creature has a 5% cumulative chance of suffocating to death. Creatures with strength between 13 and 17 can break through 1 feet of webs per turn. Creatures with 18 or greater strength break through 1° of webs per round.(N.B. Sufficient mass equates to great strength in this case,and great mass will hardly notice webs.)Strong and huge creatures will break through 1 feet of webs per segment. It is important to note that the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword will slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire — torch,flaming oil,flaming sword,etc. — will set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within the webs will take 2-8 hit points of damage from the flames,but those freed of the strands will not be harmed. Saving throw is made at -2. If the saving throw versus web is made,two results may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape then he is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape then the webs are only feet 4 strength. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

function Wish(){a="Wish (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:9 Components:V Range:Unlimited Casting Time:Special Duration:Special Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:The wish spell is a more potent version of a limited wish . If it is used to alter reality with respect to hit points sustained by a party,to bring a dead character to life,or to escape from a difficult situation by lifting the spell coster(and his or her party)from one place to another,it will not cause the magic-user any disability. Other forms of wishes,however,will cause the spell caster to be weak(-3 on strength)and require 2 to 8 days of bed rest due to the stresses the wish places upon time,space,and his or her body. Regardless of what is wished for,the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried through.(This discretionary power of the referee is necessary in order to maintain game balance. As wishing another character dead would be grossly unfair,for example,your DM might well advance the spell caster to a future period where the object is no longer alive,i.e. putting the wishing character out of the campaign.)

Note that the last two methods do not remove the wizard lock,they only negate it for a brief duration.

function WordOfRecall(){a="WordOfRecall(Alteration) Level:6 Components:V Range:0 Casting Time:1 segment Duration:Special Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description; The word of recall spell takes the cleric instantly back to his or her sanctuary when the word is uttered.The sanctuary must be specifically designated in advance by the cleric.It must be a well known place,but it can be any distance from the cleric,above or below ground.Transportation by the word of recall spell is infallibly safe.The cleric is able to transport,in addition to himself or herself,250 gold pieces weight cumulative per level of experience.Thus,a 15th level cleric could transport his or her person and 3,750(375 pounds)gold pieces weight in addition; this extra matter can be equipment,treasure,or living material such as another person.Seventh Level Spells: Astral Spell(Alteration) Level:7 Components:V,S Range:Touch Casting Time:3 turns Duration:Special Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:By means of the astral spell a cleric is able to project his or her astral body into the Astral Plane,leaving his or her physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material Plane,(the plane on which the entire universe and all of its parallels have existence),Only certain magic items which have multi-planed existence can be brought into the Astral Plane.As the Astral Plane touches upon all of the first levels of the Outer Planes,the cleric can travel astrally to any of these Outer Planes as he or she wills.The cleric then leaves the Astral Plane,forming a body on the plane of existence he or she has chosen to enter.It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell,but a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material Plane.As a general rule,a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures on the Astral Plane.At all times the astral body is connected to the material by a silvery cord.If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed,astrally and materially,but generally only the psychic wind can normally cause the cord to break.When a second body is formed on a different plane,the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body,and the cord simply returns to the latter where it rests on the Prime Material Plane,reviving it from its state of suspended animation.Although astrally projected persons are able to function ontheAstralPlane,their actions do not affect creatures not existing on the Astral Plane.The spell lasts until the cleric desires to end it,or until it is terminated by some outside means(dispel magic or destruction of the cleric s body on the Prime Material Plane).The cleric can take up to five other creatures with him or her by means of the astral spell,providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the cleric.These fellow travelers are dependent upon the cleric and can be stranded.Travel in the Astral Plane can be slow or fast according to the cleric s desire.The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the cleric.(See APPENDIX IV,THE KNOWN PLANES OF EXISTENCE,for further information on the Astral Plane and astral projection.)",b="1d20+0",c="Control",damageDice="1d8+0",getAction(t1)};
function Write(){a="Write (Evocation)Level:1 Components:V,S,M Range:0 Casting Time:1 round Duration:1 hour/level Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:One magical spell inscription Explanation/Description:By means of this spell a magic-user might be able to inscribe a spell he or she cannot understand at the time(due to level or lack of sufficient intelligence)into the tome or other compilation he or she employs to maintain a library of spells. The magic-user must make a saving throw versus magic to attempt the writing of any spell,+2 if it is only up to 1 level greater than he or she currently uses,0 at 2 levels higher,and -1 per level from 3 levels higher onwards. If this throw fails,the magic user is subject to 1d4 of damage for every level of the spell he or she was attempting to transcribe into his or her magic book,and furthermore be knocked unconscious for o like number of turns. This damage,if not fatal,can only be healed at the rate of 1-4 points per day,as it is damage to psyche and body. Furthermore,a spell will take 1 hour per level to transcribe in this fashion,and during this period,the magic- user is in a trance state and can always be surprised by any foe. In addition to the writing surface upon which the spell is to be transcribed,the spell caster needs a fine ink composed of rare substances(minimum cost 200 g-p. per bottle,if available at all without manufacture by the magic-user).
