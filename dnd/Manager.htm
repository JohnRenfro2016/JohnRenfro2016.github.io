The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal. After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.,1tgt enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.",b="1d20+0",c="summoning",damageDice="1d8+0",getAction(t1)}

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it. You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph. You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to,1tgt s physical characteristics(such as height or weight), or physical kind(for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).

For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass.

This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item s current owner. The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",b="1d20+0",c="Buff Heal",damageDice="1d8+0",getAction(t1)}

Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object. Enlargement causes increase in both size and weight. It can be cast upon only a single creature or object. Spell range is 2 feet for each level of experience of the magic-user,and its duration is 1 turn per level of experience of the spell caster. The effect of the enlargement spell is to increase the size of a living creature(or a symbiotic or community entity)by 20% per level of experience of the magic-user,with a maximum additional growth of 200%. The effect on objects is one-half that of creatures,i.e. 10% per level to a 100% maximum additional enlargement. The creature or object must be seen in order to effect the spell. The maximum volume of living material which can be initially affected is 10 cubic feet — for non-living matter,5 cubic feet — per level of the magic- user. While magical properties are not increased by this spell — a huge +1 sword is still only +1,a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions,a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate,etc. — weight,mass and strength are. Thus,a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective; a hurled stone would have more mass(and be more hurtful providing enlargement took place just prior to impact); chains would be more massive; doors thicker; a thin line turned to a sizable,longer rope; and so on. Likewise,a person 12 feet tall would be as an ogre,while an 18 feet tall person would actually be a giant for the duration of the spell. The reverse spell,reduce,will negate the effects or actually make creatures or objects smaller in the same ratios as the regular spell application functions. Unwilling victims of the spell,or its reverse,are entitled to a saving throw,which,if successful,indicates the magic does not function,and the spell is wasted,The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron, ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

function FeatherFall(){a="FeatherFall (Alteration)Level:1 Components:V,M Range:! inches feet per level Casting Time:1/10 segment Duration:1 segment/level Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:When this spell is cast,the creature(s)or object(s)affected immediately assumes the mass of a feathery piece of down. Rate of falling is thus instantly changed to a mere constant 2 feet per second or 12 feet per segment,and no damage is incurred when landing when the spell is in effect.

However,the magic-user has no control over what sort of creature will answer the summoning,or if any at all will come,and the power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. At such time as the magic-user determines to find a familiar,he or she must stoke up a brass brazier with charcoal,and when this is burning well,add 100 g.p. worth of incense,herbs(basil,savory,and catnip for sure),and fat. When these items are burning,the spell caster begins his or her incantation,and it must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished.

Each is abnormally intelligent and totally faithful to the magic-user whose familiar it becomes. The number of the familiar feet s hit points is added to the hit point total of the magic-user when it is within 12 inches of its master,but if the familiar should ever be killed,the magic-user will permanently lose double that number of hit points.

Each time a property can be known,the referee will secretly roll to see if the magic-user made his or her saving throw versus magic.

Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:Upon pronouncing the syllables of this spell,the magic-user causes an invisible force to strike against whatever object he or she is pointing at. The force of the push is not great,being 1 foot pound per level of the magic-user casting the spell,but it can move small objects up to 1 feet in adirection directly away from the caster,topple an object under the proper conditions,or cause a creature to lose its balance. An example of the latter use is causing o creature attacking to lose its balance when it is attacking,for if the creature fails its saving throw,it will not be able to attack that round. Of course,the mass of the creature attacking cannot exceed the force of the push by more than a factor of 50,i.e. a Ist level magic-user cannot effectively push a creature weighing more than 50 pounds. A push spell employed against an object held by a creature will cause it to subtract the force of the spell in foot pounds(1,2,3,etc.)from its chance to hit or add to opponent saving throws as applicable if the creature fails to make its saving throw against magic when the spell is cast.

Furthermore,once the spell is cast and the magic-user has read the magical inscription,he or she is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of the read magic spell. The duration of the spell is 2 rounds per level of experience of the spell caster. The material component for the spell is a clear crystal or mineral prism. Note that the material is not expended by use. The reverse of the spell,unreadable magic,makes such writing completely unreadable to any creature,even with the aid of a read magic,until the spell wears off or the magic is dispelled.

The volume of sound caused,however,is directly related to the level of the spell caster,The relative noise is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast,3rd level. The noise of the audible glamer at this level is that of 4 men,maximum.

These masses must be anchored to two or more points — floor and ceiling,opposite walls,etc. — diametrically opposed. The web spell covers a maximum area of 8 cubic inches,and the webs must be at least 1 inches thick,so a mass 4 inches high,2 inches wide,and 1 inches deep may be cast. Creatures caught within webs,or simply touching them,become stuck amongst the gluey fibers. Creatures with less than 13 strength must remain fast until freed by another or until the spell wears off. For every full turn entrapped by a web,a creature has a 5% cumulative chance of suffocating to death. Creatures with strength between 13 and 17 can break through 1 feet of webs per turn. Creatures with 18 or greater strength break through 1° of webs per round.(N.B. Sufficient mass equates to great strength in this case,and great mass will hardly notice webs.)Strong and huge creatures will break through 1 feet of webs per segment. It is important to note that the strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword will slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire — torch,flaming oil,flaming sword,etc. — will set them alight and burn them away in a single round. All creatures within the webs will take 2-8 hit points of damage from the flames,but those freed of the strands will not be harmed. Saving throw is made at -2. If the saving throw versus web is made,two results may have occurred. If the creature has room to escape then he is assumed to have jumped free. If there is no room to escape then the webs are only feet 4 strength. The material component of this spell is a bit of spider web. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

If that extra distance still dictates the magic-user and another solid object are to occupy the same space,the spell caster is then trapped on the ethereal plane. During and after the blink segment of a round,the spell caster can be attacked only by opponents able to strike both locations at once,e.g. a breath weapon,fireball,and similar wide area attack forms. Those not so able can only strike the magic-user if they managed to attack prior to the “blink inches segment.

[The area which is covered by the fireball is a total volume of roughly 33,000 cubic feet(or yards)1. Besides causing damage to creatures,the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst radius,and the heat of the fireball will melt soft metals such as gold,copper,silver,etc. Items exposed to the spell feet s effects must be rolled for to determine if they are affected. Items with a creature which makes its saving throw are considered as unaffected,The magic-user points his or her finger and speaks the range(distance and height)at which the fireball is to burst.

Saving throws must be made for objects which withstand the full force of a stroke(cf. fireball),The area of the lightning bolt feet s effect is determined by the spell caster,just as its distance is. The stroke can be either a forking bolt 1 inches wide and 4 inches long,or a single bolt 2 inches wide and 8 inches long. If a 12th level magic-user cast the spell at its maximum range,16 inches in this case,the stroke would begin at 16 inches and flash outward from there,as a forked bolt ending at 20 inches or a single one ending at 24 inches . if the full length of the stroke is not possible due to the interposition of a non- conducting barrier(such as a stone wall),the lightning bolt will double and rebound towards its coster,its length being the normal total from beginning to end of stroke,damage caused to interposing barriers notwithstanding. Example:An 8 inches stroke is begun at o range of 4 inches ,but the possible space in the desired direction is only 3 feet 4 inches ; so the bolt begins at the 3 feet 4 inches maximum,and it rebounds 8 inches in the direction of its creator.

However,a suggestion that a pool of acid was actually pure water,and a quick dip would be refreshing,is another matter; or the urging that o cessation of attack upon the magic-user feet s party would benefit a red dragon,for the group could loot a rich treasure elsewhere through co-operative action,is likewise a reasonable use of the spell feet s power. The course of action of a suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration,such as in the case of the red dragon mentioned above. If the recipient creature makes its saving throw,the spell has no effect. Note that a very reasonable suggestion will cause the saving throw to be made at a penalty(such as -1,-2,etc.)at the discretion of your Dungeon Master. Undead are not subject to suggestion.

Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:This spell is similar to a charm person spell ,but it will affect any living creature — or several creatures of lesser level as explained hereafter. The magic-user casts the charm monster spell,and any affected creature regards the spell casfer as friendly,an ally or companion to be treated well or guarded from harm. If communication is possible,the charmed creature will follow reasonable requests,instructions,or orders most faithfully(cf. suggestion spell). Affected creatures will eventually come out from under the influence of the spell,and the probability of such breaking of a charm monster spell is a function ofthecreaturefeets level,i.e. its number of hit dice:Monster Level Percent Chance/ or Hit Dice Week of Breaking Spell Ist or up to 2 5% 2nd or upto3 + 2 10% 3rdorupto4+4 15% 4th or up to 6 25% 5th or up to7 + 2 35% 6th or up to8 + 4 45% 7th or up to 10 60% 8th or up to 12 75% th or over 12 90% Naturally,overtly hostile acts by the person charming the monster will automatically break the spell,or at the very least allow the monster a new saving throw versus the charm.

If the magic-user continues downward beyond 5 feet ,there is a chance that the pit will collapse:15%/additional 5° in depth in earth,35%/additional 5 feet depth in sand,and 55%/additional 5 feet depth in mud. Any creature at the edge(1°)of such a pit uses its dexterity score as a saving throw to avoid falling into the hole,with a score equal to or less than the dexterity meaning that a fall was avoided. Any creature moving rapidly towards a pit area will fall in unless it saves versus magic. Any creature caught in the center of o pit just dug will always fall in.

Any creatures observing the fire or the dancing circle of flame around it must save versus magic or be charmed into remaining motionless and gazing,transfixed at the flames. While so charmed,creatures are subject to suggestion spells of 12 or fewer words,saving against their influence at -3. The fire charm is broken by any physical attack upon the charmed creature,if a solid object is interposed between the creature and the veil of flames so as to obstruct vision,or when the duration of the spell is at an end. Note that the veil of flame is not a magical fire,and passing through it incurs the same type and amount of damage as would be sustained from passing through its original fire source.

Any creature striking the spell caster with body or hand-held weapons will inflict normal damage upon the magic-user,but the attacker will take double the amount of damage so inflicted! The other spell powers depend on the variation of the spell used:A)The flames are hot,and any cold-based attacks will be saved against at +2 on the dice,and either half normal damage or no damage will be sustained; fire-based attacks are normal,but if the magic-user fails to make the required saving throw(if any)against them,he or she will sustain double normal damage.

If a fire trap is cast after a wizard lock,the former is negated,if both ore cast simultaneously both are negated,and if a wizard lock is cast after placement of a fire trap there isa 50% chance that both spells will be negated. A knock spell will not affect a fire trap in any way — as soon as the offending party enters/touches,the trap will discharge. The caster can use the trapped object without discharging it. When the trap is discharged there will be an explosion of 5 feet radius,and all creatures within this area must make saving throws versus magic. Damage is 1-4 hit points plus | hit point per level of the magic-user who cast the spell,or one-half the total amount for creatures successfully saving versus magic. The item trapped is NOT harmed by this explosion. There is only 50% of the normal chance to detect a fire trap,and failure to remove it when such action is attempted detonates it immediately.

If the victim makes his or her saving throw,the fumble will simply make him or her effectively operate at one-half normal efficiency(cf. slow spell).

Also,a pond can be made to appear as a grassy meadow,a precipice look as if it were a gentle slope,or a rock-strewn gully made to look as if it were a wide and smooth road. The hallucinatory terrain persists until a dispel magic spell is cast upon the area or until it is contacted by an intelligent creature.

Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:The polymorph other spell is a powerful magic which completely alters the form and ability,and possibly the personality and mentality,of the recipient. Of course,creatures with a lower intelligence cannot be polymorphed into something with a higher intelligence,but the reverse is possible. The creature polymorphed must make a “‘system shock inches(cf. CONSTITUTION)roll to see if it survives the change. If it is successful,it then acquires all of the form and abilities of the creature it has been polymorphed into. There is a base 100% chance that this change will also change its personality and mentality into that of the creature whose form it now possesses. For each | point of intelligence of the creature polymorphed,subtract 5% from the base chance. Additionally,for every hit die of difference between the original form and the form it is changed into by the spell,the polymorphed creature must adjust the base chance percentage by +/-5% per hit die below or above its own number(or level in the case of characters). The chance for assumption of the personality and mentality of the new form must be checked daily until the change takes place,(Note that all creatures generally prefer their own form and will not willingly stand the risk of being subjected to this spell!)If a one hit die orc of 8 intelligence is polymorphed into a white dragon with 6 hit dice,for example,it is 85%(100% - [5% X 8 intelligence1 + [(6-1)X 5%1 = 85%)likely to actually become one in all respects,but in any case it will have the dragon feet s physical and mental capabilities; and if it does not assume the personality and mentality of a white dragon,it will know what it formerly knew as well. Another example:an 8th level fighter successfully polymorphed into a blue dragon would know combat with weapons and be able to employ them with prehensile dragon forepaws if the fighter did not take on dragon personality and mentality. However,the new form of the polymorphed creature may be stronger than it looks,i.e. a mummy changed to a puppy dog would be very tough,or a brontosaurus changed to an ant would be impossible to squash merely from being stepped on by a small creature or even a man-sized one. The magic-user must use a dispel magic spell to change the polymorphed creature back to its original form,and this too requires a “system shock inches saving throw.

function PolymorphSelf(){a="PolymorphSelf (Alteration)Level:4 Components:V Range:0 Casting Time:3 segments Duration:2 turns/level Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:The magic-user Explanation/Description:When this spell is cast,the magic-user is able to assume the form of any creature — from as small as a wren to as large asa hippopotamus — and its form of locomotion as well. The spell does nor give the other abilities(attack,magic,etc.),nor does it run the risk of changing personality and mentality. No “system shock inches check is required. Thus,a magic-user changed to an owl could fly,but his or her vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings,but not the pudding feet s offensive or defensive capabilities. Naturally,the strength of the new form must be sufficient to allow normal movement. The spell caster can change his or her form as often as desired,the change requiring only 5 segments. Damage to the polymorphed form is computed as if it were inflicted upon the magic-user,but when the mogic-user returns to his or her own form,from | to 12(d12)points of damage are restored.

A strong wind will break it up in 4 rounds,and a greater wind force prevents the use of the spell. Very thick vegetation will disperse the cloud in two rounds,i.e. moving through such vegetation for 2 feet . As the vapors are heavier than air,they will sink to the lowest level of the land,even pour down den or sinkhole openings; thus,it is ideal for slaying nests of giant ants,for example.

function ConjureElemental(){a="ConjureElemental (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:5 Components:V,S,M Range:6 inches Casting Time:1 turn Duration:1 turn/level Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:There are actually four spells in one as respects conjure elemental. The magic-user is able to conjure an air,earth,fire or water elemental with this spell — assuming he or she has the material component for the particular elemental. A considerable fire source must be in range to conjure that type of elemental; a large amount of water must be likewise available for conjuration of a water elemental. Conjured elementals are very strong — see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS,MONSTER MANUAL — typically having 16 hit dice(16d8). It is possible to conjure up successive elementals of different type if the spell caster has memorized two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorizing the spell. The elemental conjured up must be controlled by the magic-user,i.e. the spell caster must concentrate on the elemental doing his or her commands,or it will turn on the magic-user and attock. The elemental,however,will not cease a combat to do so,but it will avoid creatures when seeking its conjurer. If the magic-user is wounded or grappled,his or her concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental will turn on its conjurer regardless of concentration,and this check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. The elemental can be controlled up to 3 inches distant per level of the spell caster. The elemental remains until its form on this plane is destroyed due to damage or the spell feet s duration expires. Note that water elementals are destroyed if they move beyond 6 inches of a body of water. The material component of this spell(besides the quantity of the element at hand)is a small amount of:Air Elemental — burning incense Earth Elemental — soft clay Fire Elemental — sulphur and phosphorus Water Elemental — water and sand N.B. Special protection from uncontrolled elementals is available by means of a pentacle,pentagram,thaumaturgic triangle,magic circle,or protection from evil spell.

function ContactOtherPlane(){a="ContactOtherPlane (Divination)Level:5 Components:V Range:0 Casting Time:1 turn Duration:Special Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:When this spell is cast,the magic-user sends his or her mind to another plane of existence in order to receive advice and information from powers there. As these powers are located at random,and resent such contact in any case,only brief answers will be given.(Your DM will answer all questions with a “yes inches ,“‘no inches ,“maybe inches ,never feet ,“irrelevant inches ,etc.)The character can contact an elemental plane or some plane further removed. For every 2 levels of experience of the magic-user one question may be asked. Contact with minds far removed from the plane of the magic-user increases the probability of the spell caster going insane or dying,but the chance of the power knowing the answer,as well as the probability of the being telling the correct answer,are likewise increased by moving to distant planes:Likelihood Likelihood Probability Plane ofinsanity* of Knowledge of Veracity** Elemental 20% 90%*** 75% 1 removed 5% 60% 65% 2 removed 10% 65% 67% 3 removed 15% 70% 70% 4 removed 20% 75% 73% 5 removed 25% 80% 75% é6removed 30% 85% 78% 7 removed 35% 90% 81% 8 removed 40% 95% 85% 9 or more removed 50% 98% 90% * For every-1 point of intelligence over 15,the magic user reduces probability of insanity by 5%. ** If the answer is unknown,and the answer is not true,the being will answer definitely.

function DistanceDistortion(){a="DistanceDistortion (Alteration)Level:5 Components:V,S,M Range:! inches feet per level Casting Time:6 segments Duration:1 turn/level Saving Throw:None Areo of Effect:100 square per level Explanation/Description:This spell can only be cast when the magic-user has an earth elemental conjured up,but the elemental will not react hostilely to co-operation with the spell caster when he or she announces that his or her intent is to cast a distance distortion spell,The magic places the earth elemental in the areo of effect,and the elemental then causes the area feet s dimensions to be distorted in either of two ways:1)the area will effectively be one-half the distance to those travelling over it,or 2)the orea will be twice the distance to those travelling across it. Thus a 10° X 100 feet corridor could seem as if it was but 5° wide and 50° long,or it could appear to be 20 feet wide and 200 feet long. When the spell duration has elapsed,the elemental returns to its own plane. The true nature of an area affected by distance distortion is absolutely undetectable to any creatures travelling along it,although the area will radiate a dim dweomer,and a true seeing spell will reveal that an earth elemental is spread within the area.

If made principally of wood,it must be of ebony,rosewood,sandalwood,teak or the like,and ail of its corner fittings,nails,and hardware must be of platinum. If constructed of ivory,the metal fittings of the chest may be of gold; and if the chest is fashioned from bronze,copper,or silver,its fittings may be of electrum or silver,The cost of such a chest will never be less than 5,000 g.p. Once constructed,the magic-user must have a tiny replica(of the same materials and perfect in every detail)made,so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. One magic-user can have but one pair of these chests at any given time,and even wish spells will not allow exception! While touching the chest and holding the tiny replica,the caster chants the spell. This will cause the large chest to vanish into the ethereal plone,The chest can contain one cubic foot of material per level of the magic-user no matter what its apparent size. Living matter makes it 75% likely that the spell will fail,so the chest is typically used for securing valuable spell books,magic items,gems,etc. As long as the spell caster has the small duplicate of the magic chest,he or she can recall the large one from the ethereal plane to the locale he or she is in when the chest is desired. If the miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed,there is no way,including a wish,that the large chest will return. While on the ethereal! plane,there is a 1% cumulative chance per week thet some creature/being will find the chest. If this occurs there is 10% likelihood that the chest will be ignored,10% possibility that something will be added to the contents,30% possibility that the contents will be exchanged for something else,30% chance that something will be stolen from it,and 20% probability that it will be emptied. In addition,when the secret chest is brought back to the Prime Material Plane,an ethereal window ts opened and remains open for 5 hours,slowly diminishing in size. As this hole opens between the planes there is a 5% chance that some ethereal monster will be drawn through,with a 1% cumulative reduction in probability each hour thereafter until the window is gone. However,no creature on the Prime Material Plane can locate the chest,even with a gem of seeing,true seeing,etc. \f Leomund feet s Secret Chest is not retrieved before spell duration lapses,there is a cumulative chance of 5% per day that the chest will be lost forever,i.e,5% chance for loss at 61 days,10% at 62 days,and so forth.

function MagicJar(){a="MagicJar (Possession)Level:5 Components:V,S,M Range:! inches inches per level Casting Time:1 round Duration:Special Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:Magic jar is a very unusual spell. It enables the magic user to toke over the mind of the victim and thus contro! the creature feet s body. In fact,if the body is human or humanoid,the magic-user can even use the spells he or she knows. The possessor can call upon rudimentary knowledge of the possessed,but not upon the real knowledge,i.e. a possessor will not know the language or spells of the possessed. The spell caster transfers his or her life force to a special container(a large gem or crystal),and from this magic jor the life force can sense and attack any creature within the spell range radius,but what the creature is,is not determinable from the magic jar. The special life force receptacle must be within spell range of the magic-user feet s body at the time of spell casting. Possession takes place only if the victim fails to make the required saving throw. Failure to possess a victim leaves the life force of the magic-user in the magic jor. Possession attempts require 1 round each,If the body of the spell caster is destroyed,the life force in the magic jor is not harmed. If the magic jar is destroyed,the life force is snuffed out. Returning to the real body requires 1 round,and can only be done froma magic jar in spell range of the body. The saving throw versus a magic jar spell is modified by comparing combined intelligence and wisdom scores(intelligence only in non-human or non-humanoid creatures)of the magic-user and victim. Difference Die Adjustment Negative 9 or + +4 Negative 8 to 6 +3 Negative 5 to3 +2 Negative 2 to0 +1 Positive 1 to 4 0 Positive 510 8 “l Positive 9 to 12 -2 Positive 13 or + -3 A negotive score indicates the magic-user has a lower score than does his or her intended victim; thus,the victim has a saving throw bonus. The magic jar is the spell feet s material component. Note that a possessed creature with any negative difference or a positive difference less than 5 is entitled to a saving throw each round to determine if it is able to displace the possessor feet s mind,a positive difference of 5 to 8 gains a saving throw each turn,a positive difference of 9 to 12 gains a saving throw each day,anda positive difference of 13 or better gains a saving throw each week. If the magic jorred creature regains control of its mind,the magic-user is trapped until he or she can take over the mind for control or escape.

He or she may then command it to perform as guardian of a passage,room,door,or similar space or portal. The phantom watchdog will immediately commence a loud barking if any creature larger than o cat approaches the place it guards,As the Faithful Hound is able to detect invisible,astral,ethereal,out of phase,duo-dimensional,or similarly non-visible creatures,it is an excellent guardian,In addition,if the intruding creature or creatures allow their backs to be exposed to the phantom watchdog,it will deliver a vicious attack as if it were a 10 hit dice monster,striking for 3-18 hit points of damage,and being able to hit opponents of all sorts,even those normally subject only to magical weapons of +3 or greater. The Faithful Hound cannot be attacked,but it can be dispelled.

Likewise,ambulation or some other form of motive power if the recipient of the spell is not able to ambulate,counters the effect of telekinesis,provided the velocity has not reached 16 inches per round.

function Teleport(){a="Teleport (Alteration)Level:5 Components:V Range:Touch Casting Time:2 segments Duration:Instantaneous Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Special Explanation/Description:When this spell is used,the magic-user instantly transports himself or herself,along with a certain amount of additional weight which is upon,or being touched by,the spell caster,to a well- known destination. Distance is not a factor,but inter-plane travel is not possible by means of a teleport spell. The spell caster is able to teleport a maximum weight of 2,500 g.p. equivalence,plus an additional 1,500 g.p. weight for each level of experience above the 10th,i.e. a 13th level magic-user teleports a maximum weight of 7,000 g.p.(700 pounds). If the destination area is very familiar to the magic-user(he or she has a clear mental picture through actual proximity to and studying of the area)it is unlikely that there will be any error in arriving exactly in the place desired. Lesser known areas(those seen only magically or from a distance)increase the probability of error. Unfamiliar areas present considerable peril. This is demonstrated below:Probability of Teleporting Destination Area Is High On Target Low Very familiar 01-02 | 03-99 00 Studied corefully 01-04 05-98 99-00 Seen casually 01-08 09-96 97-00 Viewed once 01-16 17-92 93-00 Never seen 01-32 33-84 85-00 Teleporting high means the magic-user will arrive 1 feet above ground for every 1% he or she is below the lowest “On Target inches probability — only 2 inches when the destination is very familiar,and as high as 32 inches if the destination area was never seen. Any low result means the instant death of the magic- user if the area into which he or she teleports to is solid,Note that there is no possibility of teleporting to an area of empty space,i.e. a substantial area of surface must be there,whether a wooden floor,a stone floor,natural ground,etc. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

The item to be magicked must meet the following tests:1)it must be in sound and undamaged condition; 2)the item must be the finest possible,considering its nature,i.e. crafted of the highest quality material and with the finest workmanship; and 3)its cost or value must reflect the second test,and in most cases the item must have a raw materials cost in excess of 100 g.p. With respect to requirement 3),it is not possible to apply this test to items such as ropes,leather goods,cloth,and pottery not normally embroidered,bejeweled,tooled,carved,and/or engraved; however,if such work or materials can be added to an item without weakening or harming its normal functions,these are required for the item to be magicked. Sie be | es — 2 = inches re | KK / oo Hy S(O ie erases 3 < A cA\,= xT sis ri =i \* rh M4 j re ly —i—,‘ 4 y y inches i P,aS,ae The item to be prepared must be touched manually by the spell caster,This touching must be constant and continual during the casting time which isa base 16 hours plus an additional 8-64 hours(as the magic-user may never work over 8 hours per day,and haste or any other spells will not alter time required in any way,this effectively means that casting time for this spell is 2 days + 1-8 days). All work must be uninterrupted,and during rest periods the item being enchanted must never be more than 1 feet distant from the spell caster,for if it is,the whole spell is spoiled and must be begun again.(Note that during rest periods absolutely no other form of magic may be performed,and the magic-user must remain quiet and in isolation.)At the end of the spell,the caster will “know inches that the item is ready for the final test. He or she will then pronounce the final magical syllable,and if the item makes a saving throw(which is exactly the some as thot of the magic-user who magicked it)versus magic,the spell is completed.(Note that the spell caster feet s saving throw bonuses also apply to the item,up to but not exceeding +3.)A result of 1 on the die(d20)always results in failure,regardless of modifications. Once the spell is finished,the magic-user may begin to place the desired dweomer upon the item,and the spell he or she plans to place on or within the item must be cast within 24 hours or the preparatory spell fades,and the item must again be enchanted. Each spell subsequently cast upon an object bearing an enchant an item spell requires 4 hours + 4-8 additional hours per spel! level of the magic being cast. Again,during casting the item must be touched by the magic- user,and during rest periods it must always be within 1° of his or her person,This procedure holds true for any additional spells placed upon the item,and each successive dweomer must be begun within 24 hours of the last,even if any prior spell failed. No magic placed on or into an item is permanent unless a permanency spell is used as a finishing touch,and this always runs a risk of draining a point of constitution from the magic-user casting the spell. It is also necessary to point out that while it is possible to tell when the basic(enchant an item)spell succeeds,it is not possible to tell if successive castings actually take,for each must make the same sort of saving throw as the item itself made. Naturally,items that are charged — rods,staves,wands,javelins of lightning,ring of wishes,etc. — can never be made permanent. Scrolls or magic devices can never be used to enchant an item or cast magic upon an object so prepared. The material component(s)for this spell vary according to both the nature of the item being magicked and successive magicks to be cast upon it. For example,a cloak of displacement might require the hides of | or more displacer beasts,a sword meant to slay dragons could require the blood and some other part of the type(s)of dragon(s)it will be effective against,and a ring of shooting stars might require pieces of meteorites and the horn of a ki-rin. These specifics,as well as other information pertaining to this spell,are known by your Dungeon Master. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

function Geas(){a="Geas (Enchantment/Charm)Level:6 Components:V Range:Touch Casting Time:4 segments Duration:Special Saving Throw:None Area of Effect:Creature touched Explanation/Description:A geas spell places a magical command upon the creature(usually human or humanoid)to carry out some service,or refrain from some action or course of activity,as desired by the spell caster. The creature must be intelligent,conscious,and under its own volition. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself,or to perform acts which are likely to result in certain death,it can cause almost any other course of action. The spell causes the geased creature to follow the instructions until the geas is completed. Failure to do so will cause the creature to grow sick and die within 1 to 4 weeks. Deviation from or twisting of the instructions causes corresponding loss of strength points until the deviation ceases. A geas can be done away with by a wish spell,but a dispel magic or remove curse will not negate it. Your referee will instruct you as to any additional details of a geos,for its casting and fulfillment are tricky,and an improperly cast geas is null and void immediately(cf. wish).

If detailed information on the person,place or thing is known,casting time is 1 to 10 days. If only rumors are known,casting time is 2 to 12 weeks. During the casting,the magic-user cannot engage in other activities other than routine:eating,sleeping,etc. When completed,the divination will reveal if legendary material is available. It will often reveal where this material is — by place name,rhyme,or riddle. It will sometimes give certain information regarding the person,place or thing(when the object of the legend lore is at hand),but this data will always be in some cryptic form(rhyme,riddle,anagram,cipher,sign,etc.).

If the caster opts,he or she may create a globe of matter at absolute zero temperature which spreads upon contact with water or liquid which is principally composed of water,so as to freeze it to a depth of 6 inches over an area equal to 100 square feet per level of the magic-user casting the spell. The ice so formed lasts for 1 round per level of the caster,The spell can also be used as a thin ray of cold which springs from the caster feet s hand to a distance of 1 inches per level of the magic- user; this ray will inflict 4 hit points of damage per level of the caster upon the creature struck,with a saving throw versus magic applicable,and all damage negated if it is successful(as the ray is so narrow a save indicates it missed),but the path of the ray being plotted to its full distance,as anything else in its path must save(if applicable)or toke appropriate damage. Finally,Otiluke feet s Freezing Sphere can be cost so as to create a small globe about the size of a sling stone,cool to the touch,but not harmful. This globe can be cast,and it will shatter upon impact,inflicting 4-24 hit points of cold damage upon all creatures within a 10° radius(one- half damage if saving throw versus magic is made). Note that if the globe is not thrown or slung within a time period equal to | round times the level of the spell caster,it automatically shatters and causes cold damage as stated above. This timed effect can be employed against pursuers,although it can also prove hazardous to the spell caster and/or his or her associates as well,The material components of the spell depend upon in which form it is to be cast. A thin sheet of crystal about an inch square is needed for the first application of the spell,a white sapphire of not less than 1,000 g.p. value for the second application of the spell,and a 1,000 g-p. diamond is minimum for the third application of the spell.

Prior to actual utterance of a spiritwrack spell the magic-user must prepare an illuminated sheet of vellum,carefully inscribed in special inks made from powdered rubies and the ichor of a slain demon of type |,Il,or Ill and covered with gold leaf in a continuous border. The spell caster must personally prepare this document,including the being feet s name thereon.(This will require from 8-32 hours of time and cost 1,000 g.p. for vellum,special pens,gold leaf,and other miscellaneous materials alone; the cost of the powdered rubies is a minimum of 5,000 g.p. for each document.)If the demon,devil,or other powerful being from a nether outer plane is present in some form(and not possessing another creature feet s body instead),the magic-user can then begin actual spell incantation. Immediately upon beginning the reading of the document,the being named will be rooted to the spot unless it makes its magic resistance percentage(adjusted for the level of the magic-user)as a saving throw; and even if such a saving throw is made,the monster feels greatly uncomfortable,and if it has not been magically forced to the locale and so held there,it is 90% likely to retreat to its own(or another)plane,as the named being is powerless to attack the magic-user while he or she is reading the spell document. This first part of the document continues for 1 full round,with the discomfort to the named being becoming greater at the end. During the second minute of the incantation,the being named undergoes acute pain and loses 1 hit point per hit die it possesses. At the end of this round of reading,the being is in wracking pain. The third and final round of utterance of the condemnation will cause a loss to the being of 50% of its existing hit points,horrible pain,and at the end consign it to some confined space on its own plane — there to remain in torture for a number of years equal to the level of the magic-user who prepared the document. Obviously,the being so dealt with will be the sworn foe of the magic-user forever afterwards,so the magic-user will be loath to finish the spell but rather use it as a threat to force submission of the being. Each round of reading will cause the being forced to listen to be a cumulative 25% likely to concede even without any other offerings or payment.

The size and strength of the magic-user increase to heroic proportions,so he or she becomes a formidable fighting machine,for the spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter! The magic-user feet s hit points double,and all damage he or she sustains comes first from the magical points gained; so if damage does not exceed original hit points,none is actually taken,but if damage beyond the additional amount is sustained,each point counts as 2(double damage). The armor class of the magic-user is a full 4 factors better than that he or she possessed prior to casting the spell(AC 10 goes to 6,AC9 to 5,AC 8 to 4,etc.),all attacks are at a level equal to those of a fighter of the same level as the magic-user(i.e.,the spell caster uses the combat table normally restricted to fighters),and although he or she can employ a dagger only in attacking,damage inflicted by the weapon is at +2 additional hit points,and 2 such attacks per round are made by the magic-user. However,it is worth noting that this spell must run its full course,and the magic-user will continue attacking until all opponents are slain,he or she is killed,the magic is dispelled,or the Transformation duration expires.

function Cacodemon(){a="Cacodemon (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:7 Components:V,S,M Range:1 inches Casting Time:Special Duration:Special Saving Throw:Special Area of Effect:Creature summoned Explanation/Description:This perilous exercise in dweomercroeft summons up a powerful demon of type IV,V,or VI,depending upon the demon feet s name being known to the magic-user. Note that this spell is not of sufficient power to bring a demon of greater power,and lesser sorts are not called as they have no known names. In any event,the spell caster must know the name of the type IV,V,or VI demon he or she is summoning. As the spell name implies,the demon so summoned is most angry and evilly disposed. The spell caster must be within a circle of protection(or a thaumaturgic triangle with protection from evil)and the demon confined within a pentagram(circled pentacle)if he or she is to avoid being slain or carried off by the summoned cacodemon. The summoned demon can be treated with as follows:1)The magic-user can require the monster to perform a desired course of action by force of threat and pain of a spiritwrack spell ,allowing freedom whenever the demon performs the full extent of the service,and forcing the demon to pledge word upon it. This is exceedingly dangerous,as o minor error in such a bargain will be seized upon by the monster to reverse the desired outcome or simply to kill and devour the summoner. Furthermore,the demon will bear great enmity for the magic-user forever after such forced obedience,so the spell caster had better be most powerful and capable. 2)By tribute of fresh human blood and the promise of 1 or more humon sacrifices,the summoner can bargain with the demon for willing service. Again,the spell caster is well advised to hove ample protection and power to defend himself or herself,as the demon might decide the offer is insufficient — or it is easier to enjoy the summoner feet s slow death — and decide not to accept the bargain as offered. Although the demon will have to abide by a pledge,as his name is known,he will have to hold only to the exact word of the arrangement,not to the spirit of the agreement. On the other hand,only highly evil magic-users are likely to attempt to strike such a bargain,and the summoned cacodemon might be favorably disposed towards such a character,especially if he or she is also chaotic. 3)The summoned demon can be the object of a trap the sou! spell ,In this case,the magic-user will not speak with or bargain for the demon feet s services,although the cacodemon might be eager to reach an accord with the dweomercraefter before he is forced into imprisonment. The trapping of the demon is risky only if proper precautions have not been taken,for failure to confine the monster usually means only that it is able to escape to its own plane. Once trapped,the demon must remain imprisoned until the possessor of his object of confinement breaks it and frees him,and this requires one service from the now loosed monster. If the individual(s)freeing the demon fails to demand a service when the mon- ster asks what is required of him,the demon is under no con- straint not to slay the liberator(s)on the spot,but if a service is required,the creature must first do his best to perform it and then return to the Abyss. The duration of service of any demon must be limited unless the demon is willing to serve for an extended period. Any required course of action or service which effectively requires an inordinate period of time to perform,or is impossible to perform,is 50% likely to free the demon from his obligations and enable him to be unconstrained in his vengeance upon the spell caster if he or she is not thereafter continually protected,for a demon so freed can remain on the plane it was summoned to for as long as 666 days. The demon summoned will be exceptionally strong,i.e. 8 hit points per hit die. Casting time is | hour per type(numeric)of the demon to be summoned,If there is any interruption during this period,the spell fails. If there is an interruption while the cacodemon is summoned,it is 10% probable that it will be able to escape its boundaries and attock the magic-user,this percentage rising cumulatively each round of continued interruption. Each demon is entitled to a saving throw versus this summoning spell. If a score higher than the level of the magic-user summoning is rolled with 3d6(2d10 with respect to type Vi demons),that particular spell failed to bring the desired demon. When this occurs,it is certain that the named demon is imprisoned or destroyed or the name used was not perfectly correct,so the spell caster will have to call upon another name to bring forth a cacodemon. The components of this spell are 5 flaming black candles; a brazier of hot coals upon which must be burned sulphur,bat hairs,lard,soot,mercuric- nitric acid crystals,mandrake root,alcohol,and a piece of parchment with the demon feet s name inscribed in runes inside a pentacle; and a dish of blood from some mammal(preferably a human,of course)placed inside the area where the cacodemon is to be held.",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

The object must be singular,can be no larger than a sword is long,have no more mass and weight than a shield(about 75 g.p. weight),and it must be non-living. To prepare this spell,the magic-user must hold a gem of not less than 5,000 g.p. value in his or her hand and utter all but the final word of the conjuration. He or she then must have this same gem available to cost the spell. All that is then required is that the magic-user utter the final word while crushing the gem,and the desired item is transported instantly into the spell caster feet s right or left hand as he or she desires. The item must,of course,have been previously touched during the initial incantation and specifically named,and only that particular item will be summoned by the spell. If the item is in the possession of another creature,the spell will not work,but the caster will know who the possessor is and roughly where he,she,or it is located when the summons is cast. Items can be summoned from other planes of existence,but only if such items are not in the possession(not necessarily physical grasp)of another creature. For each level of experience above the 14th,the magic-user is able to summon a desired item from 1 plane further removed from the plane he or she is upon at the time the spell is cast,i.e. 1 plane at 14th level,but 2 at 15th,3 at 16th,etc. Thus,a magic-user of 16th level could effect the spell even if the item desired was on the second layer of one of the outer planes,but at 14th level the magic-user would be able to summon the item only if it were on one of the Elemental Plones or the Astral or the Ethereal Plane.

function DuoDimensions(){a="DuoDimensions(Alteration)Level:7 Components:V,S,M Range:0 Casting Time:7 segments Duration:3 rounds +1 Saving Throw:None round/level Area of Effect:Personal Explanation/Description:A duo-dimension spell causes the caster to have only two dimensions,height and width but no depth. He or she is thus invisible when a sideways turn is made,and this invisibility can only be detected by means of a true seeing spell or similar means. In addition,the duo-dimensional magic-user can pass through the thinnest of spaces as long as they have the proper height according to his or her actual length — going through the space between a door and its frame is a simple matter. The magic-user can perform all actions on a normal basis. He or she can turn and become invisible,move in this state,and appear again next round and cast a spell,disappearing on the following round. Note that when turned the magic-user cannot be affected by any form of attack,but when visible he or she is subject to triple the amount of damage normal for an attack form,i.e. a dagger thrust would inflict 3-12 hit points of damage if it struck a duo-dimensional magic-user. Furthermore,the magic-user has a portion of his or her existence on the Astral Plane when the spell is in effect,and he or she is subject to possible notice from creatures thereupon. If noticed,it is 25% probable that the magic-user will be entirely brought to the Astral Plane by attack from the astral creature. The material components of this spell are a thin,flat ivory likeness of the spell caster(which must be of finest workmanship,gold filigreed,and enameled and gem-studded at an average cost of 5,000 to 10,000 g.p.)and a strip of parchment. As the spell is uttered,the parchment is given a half twist and joined at the ends. The figurine is then passed through the parchment loop,and both disappear forever.

Thus,the actuality of the past,present or future might be altered(but possibly only for the magic-user unless the wording of the limited wish is most carefully stated)in some limited manner. The use of a limited wish will not substantially change major realities,nor will it bring wealth or experience merely by asking. The spell can,for example,restore some hit points(or all hit points for a limited duration)lost by the magic-user. It can reduce opponent hit probabilities or damage,it can increase duration of some magical effect,it can cause a creature to be favorably disposed to the spell caster,and so on(cf. wish). The limited wish can possibly give a minor clue to some treasure or magic item. Greedy desires will usually end in disaster for the wisher.

The spell caster is able to mentally wield this weapon(to the exclusion of activities other than movement),causing it to move and strike as if it were being used by a fighter. The basic chance for Mordenkainen feet s Sword to hit is the same as the chance for a sword wielded by a fighter of one-half the level of the spell caster,i.e. if cast by a 14th level magic-user,the weapon has the same hit probability as a sword wielded by a 7th level fighter. The sword has no magical “‘to hit feet bonuses,but it can hit any sort of opponent,even those normally struck only by +3 weapons or astral,ethereal or out of phase; and it will hit any armor class on a roll of 19 of 20.

The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast,Thereafter the creature can withstand any inspection and appear to be a stone statue,although a faint magic will be detected from the stone if it is checked for. Despite being in this condition,the petrified individual can see,hear,and smell normally. Feeling is only as acute as that which will actually affect the granite-hard substance of the individual feet s body,i.e. chipping is equal to a slight wound,but breaking off one of the statue feet s arms is another matter. The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to normal state in 1/6 of a segment,and then return to statue state in the same period if he or she so desires,as long as the spell duration is in effect. During the initial transformation from flesh to stone,the creature must make a saving throw of 82% or less,with -1 deducted from the dice roll score for each point of his or her constitution score,so an 18 constitution indicates certain success.

Greater objects can be made to vanish,but they are simply placed into the ethereal plane and replaced with stone. Thus,a door can be made to disappear,and it will be replaced by a stone wall of 1 feet thickness,or equal in thickness to the door,whichever is greater. The maximum volume of material which can be affected is 3 cubic feet per level of experience. Thus,both weight and volume limit the spell.

Upon casting the spell,the magic-user inscribes the symbo! upon whatever surface he or she desires. Likewise,the spell caster is able to place the symbol! of his or her choice,using any one of the following:Death — One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 80 are slain. Discord — All creatures are affected and immediately fall to loudly bickering and arguing; furthermore,there is a 50% probability that creatures of different alignment will attack each other. The bickering lasts for 5-20 rounds; the fighting for 2-8 rounds. Feor — This symbo/ operates as an extra-strong fear spell,causing all creatures to save vs. the spell at -4 on the die or panic and flee os if affected by a fear spell . Hopelessness— All creatures are affected and must turn back in dejection unless they save versus magic. Affected creatures will submit to the demands of any opponent,i.e. surrender,get out,etc.; the hopelessness lasts for 3 to 12(3d4)turns,and during this period it is 25% probable that affected creatures will take no action during any round,and 25% likely that those taking action will turn back or retire from battle,as applicable. Insanity — One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 120 will become insane and remain so,acting as if a confusion spell had been placed upon them until o heal,restoration,or wish spell is used to remove the madness. Pain — All creatures are affected,having wracking pains shooting through their bodies,which causes them to have -2 on dexterity and -4 on attack dice for from 2-20 turns. Sleep — All creatures under 8+1 hit dice will immediately fall into a catatonic slumber and cannot be awakened for 5 to 16(d12 + 4)turns. Stunning — One or more creatures whose total hit points do not exceed 160 will be stunned and reeling for 3-12(3d4)rounds,dropping anything it or they hold in manipulative members. The type of symbol cannot be recognized without it being read and thus activating its effects.

function TrapTheSoul(){a="TrapTheSoul (Conjuration/Summoning)Level:8 Components:V,S,M Range:1 inches Casting Time:Special + 1 segment Duration:Permanent until broken Saving Throw:Neg. Area of Effect:One creature Explanation/Description:This spell is similar to the magic jar,except that the trap the sou! spell forces the subject creature feet s life force(and its material body,if any)into a special prison magicked by the spell caster. The subject of the spell must be seen by the caster,and the magic-user must know the subject feet s true name as well when the final word is uttered. Preparatory to the actual casting of the trap the soul,the magic-user must prepare the soul prison,a gem of 1,000 g.p. value for every hit die or level of experience the creature whose sou! is to be trapped possesses,i.e. it requires a gem of 10,000 g.p. value to trap a 10 hit dice(or 10th level)creature by placing an enchant an item spell upon it and then placing a maze spell into the gem,thereby forming the prison for the soul to be trapped. There are 2 manners in which the soul of the victim can be imprisoned. The final word of the spell can be spoken when the creature is within spell range,but this entitles it to exercise its magic resistance(if any)and a saving throw versus magic as well,and if the latter is successful,the gem shatters. The second method of soul trapping is far more insidious,for it tricks the victim into accepting a trigger object inscribed with the final spell word which will automatically place the creature feet s soul into the trap. If this method is used,it will be necessary to name the triggering item when the prison gem is magicked. A sympathy spell may be placed on the trigger item. As soon as the subject creature picks up or accepts the trigger item,its soul is automatically transferred to the gem. The gem prison will hold the soul trapped until time indefinite,or until it is broken and the soul is released,allowing the material body to reform. If the creature trapped is a powerful creature from another plane(and this could actually mean a character trapped by some inhabitant of another plone of existence when the character is not on the Prime Material Plane),it can be required to perform a service immediately upon being freed. Otherwise,the creature can go totally free once the gem imprisoning it is broken. ",b="1d20+0",damageDice=" 1+0",c="piercing ",getAction(t1)};

Any creature with fewer than eight hit dice will be blinded for from 2 to 8 turns by the colors of the sphere. This phenomenon is immobile and only the spell caster can pass in and out the prismatic sphere without harm. Note that typically the upper hemisphere of the globe will be visible,as the spell caster is at the center of the sphere,so the lower half is usually hidden by the floor surface he or she is standing upon.

Regardless of what is wished for,the exact terminology of the wish spell is likely to be carried through.(This discretionary power of the referee is necessary in order to maintain game balance.

The total hit dice of the shadow monster or monsters thus created cannot exceed the level of experience of the illusionist; thus a 10th level illusionist can create one creature which has 10 hit dice (in normal circumstances),two which have 5 hit dice (normally),etc. All shadow monsters created by one spell must be of the same sort,i.e. hobgoblins,orcs,spectres,etc. They have 20% of the hit points they would normally have. To determine this,roll the appropriate hit dice and multiply by .20,any score less than .4 is dropped — in the case of monsters with one (or fewer) hit dice,this indicates the monster was not successfully created — and scores of .4 or greater are rounded up to one hit point. If the creature or creatures viewing the shadow monsters fail their saving throw and believe the illusion,the shadow monsters perform as normal with respect to armor class and attack forms. If the viewer or viewers make their saving throws,the shadow monsters are armor class 10 and do only 20% of normal melee damage (biting,clawing,weapon,etc.),dropping fractional damage less than .4 as done with hit points.
