<h1>About This System</h1>
<img src="Magick_files/altar.jpg">
The specific earth-based religions and magickal traditions associated 
with this system of magick are called Kundalini Yoga, Shinto and Taoism 
in the east. It is associated with Wicca, Paganism, and Ceremonial 
Magick in the west. The divine is the universal spirit in fresh air, 
warm fire, clean water, and nutritious food like rice which all 
contribute to the seemingly eternal nature of life as symbolized by the 
evergreen and the mythical beast known as the dragon. When we die we 
become ancestral divinities linked to these elements which guide the 
living. There are no absolute good or absolute evil people and spirits. 
Part of our soul is enshrined and part of our soul is reborn in order to
 improve our ability to protect and purify ourselves and our world. This
 is to enjoy and understand life more fully. Rituals are focused on 
protection, purification, and the celebration of life through public 
festivals. No ritual sacrifice of animals is a part of this practice.

<h1>Toward a Creed</h1>
 <div class="columns">
<p>Love, take care of, and respect yourself first in order for you to love, take care of, and respect others better. 
</p><p>Trust, know, and depend on yourself because someday and somewhere
 everyone will let you down. Therefore do not depend entirely on things 
and others for your happiness. 
</p><p>Always think for yourself and question everything. Let your 
senses and your observation be your guide in making good choices in 
life. 
</p><p>Seek to constantly improve yourself aiming for a smarter, 
stronger, higher, more psychic, and better self. This is called the 
Great Work.

<h1>A Big Bang</h1>
 <div class="columns">
<p>From the nothingness there was a small, chaotic, single, hot, 
explosive birth of time and space that is still expanding outward like a
 balloon. This is the exhale of the universe where matter and antimatter
 fought for control. The orderly inhale of the universe is a rapidly 
cool gravitational pull. This breathing creates ripples, waves, and 
swirls of surviving matter forming simple and complex orbits of stars 
and atoms. Big stars blow-up and little stars fade out creating a baby 
star nursery nebula.
</p><p>The most complex organization of matter that we know of is the 
human brain which represents a small part of the universe which can 
understand itself. Furthermore, the human brain seems to participate in 
the perception of the universe adding to and changing it. Therefore, 
perhaps the human brain is the mother of god and god is the mother of 
the human brain in a cycle of creation. Present to past moving around 
again to the present. 
</p><p>But a question that may not be understood by the human brain 
because it is still improving and trying to understand itself and the 
universe is, what exists outside of this mother of god and god cycle? 
What gave birth to this cycle of the universe? To fathom this question 
is to enter a state of madness. It is better to accept that there are 
things beyond human understanding that remain a mystery.
</p><p>The universe will most likely cool and contract back into its 
single point only to explode again in an endless cycle. In this ebb and 
flow of consciousness and uconsciousness, we strive to preserve 
teachings and memories, retrieving them from our past lives and 
universes to aid every new life.

<h1>Three Universal Axioms</h1>
<p class="p2">"All things change in an orderly and cyclical manner. The only constant of nature is change. This is a paradox." 
</p><p class="p2"> "All things have an equal and opposite thing. For every action there is a reaction." 
</p><p class="p2"> "When two opposite things are carried to their 
extremes they become the same thing. The microcosmic world is similar in
 shape and property to the macrocosmic world."

<h1>A Theological Conversation</h1>
<h3>Animism</h3>
<p class="p3">This is the religious belief that the divine is manifest 
in all things, in nature, including the self. All that is perceived 
contains the divine. 
</p><h3>Polytheism</h3>
<p class="p3">This is the religious belief that the divine is personified as goddesses and gods who influence humanity. 
</p><h3>Monotheism</h3>
<p class="p3">This is the religious belief that the divine is personified as one Goddess or God who has total influence over humanity.
</p><h2>Pantheism</h2>
<p class="p2">The divine is manifest in all things, in nature, including
 the self, personified as goddesses and gods who represent different 
aspects of one divine God/dess who influences humanity. It encompasses 
animism in that the divine is on the land, in the sea, through the sky, 
and sparkles in fire. We see the goddesses and gods within our dreams 
and commune with them. They are aspects of one divine source. God/dess 
represents all that is beneficial to us and our social group. We worship
 those life giving elements. God/dess is fresh air, water, and rich soil
 that grows the natural foods that we consume. God/dess is the fire that
 warms us and helps us to defend. The mythical animal which symbolizes 
this is the dragon. 
</p><h2>Yin, Yang, and Tao</h2>
<p class="p2">All things are opposite in relation to each other. These 
things either balance out or throw the system into chaos. The Tao is 
both the status-quo and evolution. Order and chaos interact to create 
life and improvement. The Tao is all. It is the death of one moment and 
the birth of another. Without Yin and Yang in our lives we can't 
experience the Tao. Without the ups and downs in our personal 
soap-operas we won't learn and improve in mind and flesh. 
</p><p class="p2">Going back to human origins, we were savanna monkeys 
who played dangerous food stealing games with big cats. We worked in 
groups and retreated to tall trees and water to safely eat the gathered 
grains, berries, and stolen meat. Those of us who were not clever or 
fast were eaten. Then there was the trial of ice ages and fire hot 
droughts. Those who did not pass starved to death. 
</p><p class="p2">We must continue to improve ourselves and our friends 
and families even though we have reduced these threats to our survival. 
This is the Great Work of this religious and magickal practice. 
</p><p class="p2">In the mythology of this religion and magickal system 
the dragon is both the androgynous parent and the child of the crescent 
horned hunter goddess of lakes and the moon representing the feminine 
element and the beast horned god of woods and the sun representing the 
masculine element.

<h1>What is the Law</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>Survive</h2>
<p class="p2">Every breath we take kills microscopic life in our mouths.
 We are constant killers. Life preys on life to survive. Humans evolved 
in the savannas in teams gathering food and scavenging meat from 
dangerous hunting animals. We are social animals. Since teamwork is our 
method of survival we must become a strong team by creating laws for the
 treatment of each other. There must be mutual respect for life and 
property within our team. 
</p><h3>The Law of Action</h3>
<p class="p3">Do what you want to do with consenting others in the privacy of your own home just don't hurt anyone.
</p><p class="p3">Judge others based upon merit and ability. Do not 
judge others based on race, color, class, gender, sexual orientation, 
lifestyle, or any other irrelevant factor. 
</p><h3>The Law of Reaction</h3>
<p class="p3">If at all possible, try to live in peace with those members of your team. But if it is not possible, then ask these questions. 
</p><ul>
<li>Is this person threatening my life? 
</li><li>Is this person threatening those I love? 
</li><li>Is this person threatening my vital resources? 
</li></ul>
<p class="p3">You try to reason with the person and they don't listen. 
Then war is the result. Show no mercy and observe no rules. Destroy 
them.
</p><p class="p3">Now the most effective way to destroy someone without 
destroying yourself is to bring notification of their life and property 
threatening actions before the authorities. It is best to be brave. 
However, if there are no authorities in a life threatening situation, 
then you become the authority. It is either you and your loved ones or 
them. Be brave and be martially trained. If at all possible, aid and 
escape from the situation. If not, then fight with a hate greater than 
you have ever known.

<h1>Ideology</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>Pro-Conservation</h2>
<p class="p2">We recognize that nature is our habitat. It needs to be 
protected if we are to protect ourselves. This protective plan involves a
 few practices. 
</p><h3>Reduction of Dangerous Elements</h3>
<p class="p3">Dangerous elements are not naturally concentrated in the 
air, water, and soil that we consume. Our industries need to neutralize 
those concentrations to make our living environment a healthy one. Fuel 
emissions, minerals, chemicals, sewage, and electro-magnetic fields need
 to be studied and treated. We get politically involved with issues 
where personal greed comes into conflict with community health by 
communicating with our governments and drawing attention to it.
</p><h3>Recycling</h3>
<p class="p3">Science has developed ways for us to reduce trashed 
packaging and materials into useful packaging and materials. Take the 
time to separate your trash if your recycling plant requires it. The 
reduction of trash dumps and the need to mine fresh materials will make 
our society more efficient. 
</p><h3>Bio-Diversity</h3>
<p class="p3">The eco-system can only support a limited population of 
human life. Most of the planet requires space for the basic things. 
Forests are the lungs of the Earth. Remove them and we remove our air. 
Within these forests is a variety of life that can be studied to benefit
 us. Cultural diversity is also a part of bio-diversity. Racial 
diversity is also healthy and stimulates life and advancement. 
</p><h2>Self Respect</h2>
<p class="p2">Having a healthy respect for nature also means having a 
healthy respect for our own bodies. We are part of nature and not above 
it. It is our personal duty to ourselves and each other to take care.
</p><h2>Pro-Eclectic</h2>
<p class="p2">We see that the world is becoming a global economy and 
that the United Nations is a good way to organize and pay for programs 
of global concern. Yet nations, states, religions, and ethnic groups 
deserve representation and need protection from centralized power that 
would try to take over issues that these entities can execute better by 
themselves. In the future we will see a World Federation. Personal 
choices of religion and culture should be preserved as long as no 
violence is involved. The protection and improvement of the quality of 
human life will be our primary concern. 
</p><h2>Pro-Education</h2>
<p class="p2">We see the continual education of the person as essential 
to growth and evolution for the human race. Education is also a means to
 boost self-esteem and place value in human life. Respect for the life 
of others begins with a respect for the self. Education is a means of 
spawning industry and employment. Experimentation with and the 
observation of nature is the most valuable tool we have to learn.
</p><h2>Pro-Family Planning</h2>
<p class="p2">We support the idea of planned pregnancy. This is where 
two adults agree to come together, start a family, and raise the 
children to an autonomous age. Children need mentors. Adult females and 
males are there to serve as models for social behavior and advice. Some 
couples encounter critical trouble and divorce, yet children should 
continue to be cared for. Over-population produces much suffering in a 
world of unequal distribution. We can regulate ourselves without the 
natural predators of war, famine, disease, and poverty. 
</p><h2>Pro-Free Speech</h2>
<p class="p2">The free flow of ideas should be encouraged. These ideas 
should be anti-violent concerning theological, ideological, and 
philosophical revolution. If we can spurn society from physically 
destroying itself, yet circulate ideas that improve it, then society 
evolves.

<h1>Know Thyself</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p class="p2">Be totally honest with this question. Start your own 
document. List as many virtues as you have vices. However, do not 
verbally criticize or degrade yourself before others. Also do not praise
 yourself before others. Let your actions speak for you.
</p><p class="p2">In your own document, record the quotes you live by, 
poetry that depicts you, your motto, and your personal code of ethics. 
Illustrate your self description. 
</p><h2>Who am I becoming?</h2>
<p class="p2">Only list constructive attributes that you wish to 
acquire. Affirm the virtues you wish to keep. Note the qualities of your
 role models and heroes. Aspire to be more like them. Know that to 
change for the better and improve, is one of life's main missions. We 
live so that we might learn to live better. This is how to change for 
the better. 
</p><ul>
<li>First, we must desire to change. 
</li><li>Second, we must know how to change. 
</li><li>Last, we must actively change through constant relaxation and 
practice. We train our muscles and our minds to master control of 
ourselves. 
</li></ul>
<h2>What do I have?</h2>
<p class="p2">List all of your possessions, titles, occupations, and 
loved ones in your document. Affirm that none of these define who you 
are, but help you to live a better life. Sometime, somewhere, everyone 
and everything will let you down. Only you can trust in and depend on 
yourself. From this, others can then trust and depend on you. Keep a 
history of all the success you have had in the past. List all of 
the goals you have fulfilled. 
</p><h2>What do I want?</h2>
<p class="p2">List all of your dreams and goals for a constructive 
future. If you have no goal and mission in life, then find one as this 
is the primary reason to live. Love yourself and take healthy care of 
yourself and your needs first so that you may better care for others. 
Know that everyone needs these things in order of critical importance. 
</p><ul>
<li>We need to breathe fresh air. 
</li><li>We need shelter. 
</li><li>We need to drink fresh water. 
</li><li>We need to eat healthy whole foods. 
</li><li>We need to rest and sleep. 
</li><li>We need to feel useful and loved. 
</li><li>We need to understand and be understood. 
</li><li>We need to accomplish our goals.
</li></ul>
<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<p class="p2">If confronted with a problem, welcome and value it as a 
learning
experience. Think about the problem and debate as to what the true 
source and
origin of the problem is. Attack the source and origin of that problem 
with patience and
consistence. Always think about the things that will grant you 
happiness, health and
freedom. If tempted, always choose the thing that will grant you long 
term
happiness. Do not choose the thing that will grant you short term 
temporary
gratification at the expense of the future. If you struggle with 
temptation, consider all of the opportunities you will miss and all the 
things you will not have if you choose the wrong
thing. Then think of all the opportunities you will create for yourself 
and
all the things you will have if you choose the right thing. If you do 
happen to keep choosing the wrong things, never give up. Keep thinking 
about what is right for you and strive to choose what is right for you. 
Do not give up. Program magickal spheres to serve as little helpers when
 you are
confronted with a choice. Program these spheres with what you have 
decided is good for you. They will remind you.

<h1>The Metaphysical Dictionary</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>Magickal Energy</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the energy that vibrates at the level between 
thought energy and tangible energy. Therefore, if you can imagine 
something, then something is possible. 
</p><h2>Magick</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the art of turning ideas into reality with the aid
 of magickal energy. Conscious will directs this. To those who are 
constantly aware of magick around them and in them, magick is a way of 
life.
</p><h2>Magickian</h2>
<p class="p2">This is anyone who practices magick. The word 'magic' is 
used to mean those who perform stage magic tricks. 'Magick' with a 'k' 
is reserved for those who use magickal energy to perform magick.
</p><h2>Magickal Shell</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the egg shaped, protective field of magickal 
energy around every person. This magickal shell is also your personal 
sense of space. If people get too close to your personal sense of space,
 you may object by moving away and keeping some distance. During times 
of stress, looking down, crossing your arms and legs is a natural and 
often subconscious way you strengthen your magickal shell. Rocking and 
fidgeting is a way to absorb power for this strengthening. The sphere is
 in the shape of an egg as a subconscious memory of the ultimate 
protection received in the mother's womb. The astral silver cord also 
comes from that memory and connects your magickal shell to your current 
physical and magickal body and those magickal bodies of your past lives.
 Think of the astral silver cord as a necklace of pearls.
</p><h2>Magickal Body</h2>
<p class="p2">This body is composed of magickal energy. It envelopes the
 shape of the physical body. This is also known as the soul. A spirit is
 a dis-incarnate soul. It lacks a physical body. The spirit may also be 
defined as a string of past life souls which define the long term 
missions and character of the person throughout the ages. If you place 
your arm against a white wall in a dimly lit room and relax your eyes 
for several minutes focusing on the edge of your arm, you will see a 
glow extend over 2 centimeters. This is both the over-stimulation of the
 rods and cones in your eyes and also the representative image of your 
soul. 
</p><h2>Magickal Sphere</h2>
<p class="p2">Magick Spheres are constructed baseball size globes of 
energy that vibrate between thought energy and physical energy. They are
 portable programmable packets of magick that a magickian can store into
 objects for later use or execute dynamically. The largest magickal 
sphere the magickian works with is the magickal shell.

</p><h2>Magickal Sphere Visualization Exercises</h2>
<p class="p2">Breathe in white light and send it below your heart. 
Breath out and soak up black light and send it below your heart. Send 
the mixed gray light out in front of you and swirl it clockwise into a 
baseball.

</p><h3>Telekinesis</h3><p class="p3">Attach the gray sphere to a small 
object and imagine lifting it to you. Encase the object in the 
protective gray sphere and teleport it back to its original position. 
Summon the gray sphere back before you.

</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p class="p3">Turn the gray sphere into an orange 
sphere and lift it to your face. Send visions and words into the orange 
sphere and attach the sphere to your friend. Imagine your friend 
understanding your messages. Summon the sphere back and attach it to 
yourself. Imagine comprehending your friend's thoughts. Return the 
sphere back to just above your hands.

</p><h3>Pyrokinesis</h3><p class="p3">Turn it into a flaming red sphere and move it around in front of you. Summon it back before you.

</p><h3>Electrokinesis</h3><p class="p3">Turn it into an electrified purple sphere and move it around in front of you. Summon it back before you.

</p><h3>Cryokinesis</h3><p class="p3">Turn it into an icy blue sphere and move it around in front of you. Summon it back before you.

</p><h3>Morphokinesis</h3><p class="p3">Turn it into a green jelly-like sphere. Expand it and contract it. Change it into a cube and back into a sphere. 

</p><h3>Genekinesis</h3><p class="p3">Imagine the green sphere start to 
glow yellow. Enlarge it and encase your mirror image. See yourself 
becoming brighter and healthier. Then shrink the yellow sphere and send 
it into your mirror image.

</p><h2>Telekinesis Exercises</h2>
<p class="p2">Fold a paper in half, horizontally, then vertically. Cut a
 square half the size of your hand from the corner that contains the 
center of the paper and unfold it to form a four sided umbrella. Find a 
pen and place it upright in a vice such as two or more books. Balance 
the center of the paper umbrella on the upright pen. Place your hands 
around the device without touching it. Perform the magickal sphere 
exercise. Use your eyes and palms shape the magickal sphere into arms 
extending out to move the umbrella clockwise and counterclockwise 
according to the wishes of your magickal will.

</p><h2>Magickian's Will</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the conscious self awareness of the magickian 
which controls all voluntary actions. The magickian's will generates and
 directs magickal energy. The magickian can activate the magickal 
points, to be further explained, by focusing this magickal will upon 
them. 

</p><h2>Magickal Tolerance</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the amount of magickal energy that the magickian's
 will can contain within the magickal shell and magickal body without 
convulsing. This tolerance 
is high or low based on diet, stress, and practice. 

</p><h2>Magickal Spells</h2>
<p class="p2">These are programmed packages of magickal energy that turn
 specific desires into reality when executed. Shape spells into the form
 of a baseball size sphere to be infused into objects, words, and 
manipulated by gestures. 

</p><h2>Magickal Rituals</h2>
<p class="p2">These are routines for generating, directing and programming magickal energy to create a magickal spell. 

</p><h2>Sorcery</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the art of storing magickal spells into objects, words, gestures, potions, and powders for later use. 
</p><h2>Magickal Points</h2>
<p class="p2">These points are small circular surfaces on the magickal 
body that change the frequency of magickal energy. When a magickal point
 is active, there will be a pressure similar to the sensation of someone
 pressing a coin on that area of the person's skin. Each magickal point 
is unique and represents an archetypal force in nature. When they become
 activated they take the shape of a baseball size magickal sphere 
resting on the place indicated by the chart below. There are also 
physical places in the body that correspond to magickal points. These 
points may also be thought of as gates that restrict or permit magickal 
power.

<h1>Telepathic Skills</h1>
<h2>Akasha</h2>
<p class="p2">This is a frequency of magickal energy programmed as 
information which can be interpreted by one of the magickal senses 
defined below. Akasha is the substance of history itself. It is the 
magnetic memory of the present. It also includes the probable future 
that we will record, shape and change into the past. 
</p><h2>Precognition</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of perceiving the future. If no 
prudence is taken after the precognitive performance, the event will 
occur exactly as prophesied. Focus your magickian's will above the eye 
which is opposite your writing hand. 
</p><h2>Telecognition</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of perceiving details of the 
present physical world via the remote senses. It is the seeing, hearing,
 and feeling of distant events. Focus your magickian's will above the 
middle of your eyes. 
</p><h2>Postcognition</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of perceiving the past. The past 
is a mist of information in the form of magickal energy called akasha 
extending out into the universe from the action's point of origin. All 
objects contain vibrations of past information. Focus your magickian's 
will above the eye on the same side as your writing hand. 
</p><h2>Clairvoyance</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of using the visual mode to 
receive akasha. Make a fist with your left hand and extend the index 
finger. Clench the index finger with your right hand. Press your right 
thumb into the index nail there. Focus your attention between your eyes 
and a circuit that descends from there, through the center of your body 
down the inseams of your legs, and ending at your feet. After focusing 
your magickian's will upon these pathways, focus your attention on 
seeing the precognitive, telecognitive, or postcognitive Akasha. 
</p><h2>Clair-audience</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of using the audible mode to 
receive akasha. Place your hands together and fold your fingers inside, 
cupping them. Focus your attention on your throat and a circuit that 
loops over your ears and descends to the outer flanks of your legs, 
ending at your feet. After focusing your magickian's will upon these 
pathways, focus your attention on hearing the precognitive, 
telecognitive, or postcognitive Akasha. 
</p><h2>Psychometry</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of using the tactile mode to 
receive akasha in the form of emotion, texture, taste, and smell. Place 
your hands together and fold your fingers over them. Focus on your solar
 plexus and a circuit that forms a belt around your waist. Focus on 
sensing the environment of your magickal shell. Touching any object will
 give you akashic impressions that will translate into visions and 
sounds about the past, associated things in the present, and possible 
future. 
</p><h2>Conversion</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal art of seeing, hearing, and feeling 
emotions. It is the art of seeing music, and hearing color. It is the 
art of feeling music and art. 
</p><h2>Disassociation</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of perceiving the self as two or 
more selves. This mental ability gives us the power of introspection. 
This is the ability to perceive and judge ourselves from a distance. 
</p><h2>Blast</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the defensive ability to overload the target's 
magickal tolerance with akasha. This causes temporary insanity, 
migraines, amnesia, blindness, deafness, muteness, and paralysis. The 
symptoms depend where the blast is focused. Send the blast in the form 
of a baseball size magickal sphere. 
</p><h2>Send</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of transmitting an akashic message to a subject in the form of a baseball size magickal sphere. 
</p><h2>Jam</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of blocking the transmission of 
akasha or any frequency of magickal energy. Covering the stomach is the 
magickal gesture of this ability as well as crossing the arms and legs. 
Make a fist with the left hand. Now cover that fist with your right 
hand. This gesture symbolizes the magickal shell that protects you. 
Imagine you are in a large magickal sphere that reflects energy away and
 out.
</p><h2>Scan</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of searching and touching a 
particular form of akasha that represents the information you are trying
 to find. Imagine sending out many baseball size magickal spheres.
</p><h2>Receive</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal act of perceiving akasha from a 
sender. Imagine you are in a large magickal sphere attracting the 
sender's baseball size magickal spheres.
</p><h2>Drain</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the magickal ability to absorb magickal energy 
from the environment. Raising the arms is the magickal gesture of this 
ability. Spread the fingers of both hands before you and place your 
index fingers and thumbs together. This symbolizes the act of catching 
and encircling magickal energy. Imagine you are in a large magickal 
sphere attracting energy.

<h2>Lucid Dreaming</h2>
<p class="p2">This is the art of being fully conscious within your 
dreams while they are occurring. Lucid dreaming is like being on a movie
 set where you control the special effects, the actors, the backdrop, 
and the plot. Perform all of your magickal rituals within a lucid dream 
in the same way you performed them while awake. Every single time you 
wake up, ask yourself if you are dreaming.
</p><h3>WILDS</h3>
<p class="p3">Wake Induced Lucid Dreams. Rest on your back and tense all
 of your muscles while counting from ten to zero. At zero, release all 
the tension and visualize a warm current enveloping and relaxing you 
more. Close your eyes and don't move even when your body is trying to 
get your mind to move it. The warm current will become strong for about 5
 seconds and you will feel as if you are floating. Follow hypnagogic 
images into a lucid dream.

<h2>Magickal Ritual Components</h2>
<p class="p2">Below are the components of the magickal ritual. They are 
listed to remind the magickian to make use of all of them for greater 
effect. The basics are polished continually throughout the magickian's 
life. 
</p><h3>Perceptual Components</h3>
<p class="p3">Our self-imposed visual, audible, and tactile illusions 
that stem from our semi-awakened dream state, color the invisible 
magickal energy in the waking world that we use to change the waking 
world. 
</p><h3>Verbal Components</h3>
<p class="p3">Our words are called verbal affirmations because we 
condition our own minds and the minds of others to accept the fact that 
magickal energy is creating reality from our dreams. The words toggle 
our normal everyday perception to magickal perception and back again. 
</p><h3>Somatic Components</h3>
<p class="p3">Our movements with our hands and bodies are called somatic
 gestures. This is a dance that symbolizes magickal properties and 
abilities. We wish to control our own ability to alter reality using 
these cues. 
</p><h3>Material Components</h3>
<p class="p3">These are physical artifacts and ingredients that 
symbolize magickal concepts. They too are cues that trigger the mind's 
ability to sew the fabric of the future. 
</p><h2>Redirection of Magickal Energy</h2>
<p class="p2">There are many methods by which the magickian can generate
 and redirect magickal energy to fuel the magickal ritual. The more 
methods that are used, the more spectacular the results of the ritual 
will be. This compound effect is typical of magickal synchronicity. 
</p><h3>Sleep Saturation</h3>
<p class="p3">Set your alarm for one hour before you normally wake up. 
Wake up and reset it for one hour later. During this hour, practice deep
 meditation and lucid dreaming using the techniques given above. A 
healthy plan is to wake up naturally and over sleep while practicing 
these techniques. 
</p><h3>Study</h3>
<p class="p3">The magickian can redirect energy towards a magickal 
ritual by the study of myth, legend, and fictional and non-fictional 
books about magick. The magickian can also fuel the ritual by drawing 
pictures of the magickian's desires, or drawing symbols of them. 
Studying the details of why you desire something and the symbolism that 
goes into the ritual, also fuels the routine. 
</p><h3>Chanting</h3>
<p class="p3">Poetry is concise and rhythmic. Since we wish to merge 
with nature's cyclic movements, a rhyme is a perfect way to do it. 
Repeating the rhyme is a way to focus our intentions and break through 
our conscious notion that we "CAN'T." Chanting is a way to contact the 
subconscious which is there to fulfill our wish. Chanting alters our 
state of mind and conditions our conscience. The magickal energy of our 
chants fuels the magickal ritual. 
</p><h3>Fasting</h3>
<p class="p3">This is a way to redirect the energy that would go towards
 digestion to the magickal ritual. On the morning of your day off 
consume nothing but fruit and water. Fruit does not need to be digested.
 On the night of the ritual the energy will be added to the magickal 
work. Do not perform fasting over three days. 
</p><h3>Chastity</h3>
<p class="p3">This is a way to redirect the energy that would go towards
 reproduction and satisfaction towards the magickal ritual. Abstain from
 all forms of sexual contact and material on the morning of your day off
 till the actual magickal ritual that evening. Do not practice chastity 
over three days. 
</p><h2>Successful Spell Casting</h2>
<p class="p2">Think clearly about what you really need and document it 
clearly. Document a list of your long term goals and give them priority.
 Nothing is too fantastic. Nothing is forbidden less hurting or 
controlling another. Adhere to the basic premise of the need for 
personal health
and happiness. Then extend the wealth of your magick to those you love. 
Do not inform anybody what your goal is least they take all the power
out of it. 
</p><p class="p2">The best time to cast a spell is when you have need of
 it. Having said that, you can perform a long ritual in order to prepare
 that spell which involves phases of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars. 
If Planetary magick is indeed your source of magickal power, then work 
with
the associations of color, incense, music, and any other element 
associated with your goal. Perform the ritual alone and without 
interruption. 
</p><p class="p2">As for the other aspects of timing, do not demand a 
specific time by which the spell will be completed. While waiting, do 
not speak of the spell. Once you forget, that is when the spell works 
best. 
</p><p class="p2">Power raising during ritual starts with the focus upon
 a single source such as one of the planets. Invocation of the power of 
that source into yourself is the next step. Dance in ritualistic poses 
and directions. Chant specific rhymes in your chosen language related to
 the ritual and the goal of the ritual. Then end your ritual with "In 
that this harms none, so be it."

<h1>Magickal Artifacts</h1>
<p>The magickian uses these artifacts to aid in the generation and 
direction of magickal energy. Magickal artifacts are helpful symbols 
that the conscious mind uses to communicate with the subconscious mind. 
These are some of the material components of the magickal ritual. The 
ritual place can be thought of as a spiritual ship that protects the 
magickian and generates, stores, and distributes magickal energy. 
</p><h2>The Magickian's Vestments</h2>
<p class="p2">The clothing worn during the magickal ritual must be 
comfortable, usually a robe with a hood which is clean and white. It is 
to only be worn when performing the ritual duties of a magickian. Find a
 piece of jewelry to wear that represents your magickal self. Give 
yourself a magickal name that you will use to identify the magickian 
within. The hood is worn to place the magickian in an introspective 
mindset. 
</p><h2>The Magickian's Study</h2>
<p class="p2">This is any indoor ritual place that is hidden from the 
view of others. The answering machine is set at a low volume. Shades and
 curtains are closed. Working by glass shielded candle light with 
incense in the air sets the magickal mood. Spiritual music in the 
background enhances the atmosphere.
</p><h2>The Magickian's Triangle</h2>
<p class="p2">The Magickian's Triangle symbolizes manifesting the divine
 into material form. The Waxing, New and Waning Moon symbols are placed 
in each apex. Place two shield covered candles on the Waxing and Waning 
Moon symbols and your birth stone on the New Moon symbol. 
</p><h2>The Magickian's Circle</h2>
<p class="p2">This is a symbol of the celestial zodiac, the greatest 
circle that we can see with unaided eyes. The zodiac represents 
spiritual armies that protect our minds and bodies from harm. The 
magickian's circle is an artifact that helps contain the magickal shell 
and the effects of our ritual, magickal castle. We stand inside the 
magickian's circle when performing a magickal ritual. Another similar 
prop is the magickian's ring with the symbols of the zodiac imprinted on
 
it. It functions as a portable magickian's circle.
</p><h2>The Magickian's Altar</h2>
<p class="p2">The magickian's altar is table furniture symbolic of the 
philosopher's stone which is a six sided cube. When opened each side 
forms a cross. Within are the dark aspects of the magickian's mind as 
well as the rewards that come from the understanding of nature. It is 
the altar whereby the elementals reside during a ritual. There are 4 
types of elementals that interact with you to form a pentagram.
</p><p class="p2"> The surface of the altar is sectioned off into a 3 x 3
 table of squares. Place each artifact in this order. The elementals are
 invited with the tools and rest in the elements of the corners in a 
clockwise rotation. In some altars is placed a manufactured red rose and
 a crown. Or perhaps a hand mirror and a letter opener. It symbolizes 
the beauty and wealth acquired when one learns the secrets of nature 
contained within the altar or philosopher's stone.

<h2>Astral Travel</h2>
<p class="p2">
There are three worlds. There is the physical world, the dream world, 
and the place that binds the worlds together, called the magickal, or 
astral world. The astral world is the magickal akashic energy of the 
physical world without the physical objects that this energy mirrors. 
The astral world is a combination of dreams and reality. 
</p><p class="p2">Look at the details of your magickian's study. Find a 
comfortable place and 
perform the lucid dreaming exercises. Within the lucid dream, conjure 
the exact representation of your study. Say within the dream, "I'm in 
the astral world." After saying the words, you will float above your 
physical body. You will see a silvery blue umbilical cord from your 
astral belly button to your physical belly button. 
</p><p class="p2">Making sense of magickal artifacts is now easy if we 
visualize the magickian's circle, altar, and tools, as different aspects
 of an astral submarine that we use to sail around in the astral world. 
The magickian's circle strengthens the magickal shell of the magickian, 
which serves as the hull of the submarine. This hull protects us from 
the waters of the unknown but allows us to view this mysterious world. 
The altar and tools serve as the astral craft's controls. We use these 
controls to create the star gates which allow the elemental cultures to 
locate and visit us. 
The magickal body also serves as a protective environmental suit of 
armor.

<h2>Unavoidable Poisons</h2>
<p class="p2">Radiation from monitors, wireless communications, and 
power-lines is changing 
our DNA and causing cancer and sterilizaiton. This can be off-set by 
following 
good eating guidelines. Mercury and other metal in our food is also 
causing nerve and

<h2>Magickal Rituals and Exercises For Groups</h2><p class="p2">
</p><h3>Illusions</h3><p class="p3">Perform this party trick with people who are interested in learning 
magick. This challenges people's normal sense of reality and opens their 
minds to new possibilities. Have the subject lie down on their stomach. with 
their hands extended out above them. Stand over and straddle them. Tell them to 
look straight at the floor. Now grab their arms and tell them to close their 
eyes as you lift them half off the ground. As you are lifting them up, tell them 
to let their head relax and drop with their eyes still closed. Now tell them 
that you are going to lower them right through the floor. With their eyes closed 
you lower them down again. In their minds they think that the floor is in a 
place that it isn't. This is an error of perception. So they feel a phantasmal 
representation of the floor and go right through it. This is the nature of 
illusion. </p></div>

<h3>Glamour</h3>
<p class="p3">This is the art of getting other people to perceive your fantasy. This is the 
art of making others have errors in perception. This is hypnosis. 
First, never tell the subject that you are going to perform an illusion. The 
main principle here is subtile trickery. Establish a conversation of mundane or 
fantastic topics with the subject. Twirl a small object such as a pen in the 
subject's peripheral view. Soften your tone, use rhythmic meter and watch the 
subject's eyes. When the subject's eyes dim, in the same tone, suggest something 
illogical. "Cats taste like velvet under broken glass." Then say your 
suggestion. "You look great today."</p></div>

<h2>Telepathy</h2>
<p class="p2">To be a telepath. That is, someone who knows the thoughts of others, you must 
master the basics of observation. You must determine what mode of communication 
they are using. 
</p><h3>The Visual Mode</h3><p class="p3">If they look up, scratch the head, and, or say something 
like; "I see what you're saying." They are in the visual mode of communication. 
</p><h3>The Audible Mode</h3><p class="p3">If they look to the sides, rub the nose, and, or say 
something like; "I hear what you're saying." They are in the audible mode of 
communication. 
</p><h3>The Tactile Mode</h3><p class="p3">If they look down, scratch the chin, cover the stomach, 
or say something like; "I feel good about that," then they are in the tactile 
mode of communication.</p></div>

<h2>Sympathy</h2>
<p class="p2">This method is used to communicate our friendly support of others. Let the 
subject determine the range of contact between you. Ask the subject to tell you 
what is happening in their life. Listen without giving unsolicited advice or 
criticism. Let them know that you are listening by repeating, paraphrasing, or 
giving a gesture of attention, such as a nod. When the subject asks you for 
advice or criticism, respond in the same perception mode that they do. Make it 
constructive and focus on the behavior, event, or problem. Copy the subject's 
movements without appearing to mock them. Alternate your gaze from their chin to 
the right and left temples. When the subject expresses something with emphasis, 
gaze into their eyes. </p></div>

 <div class="columns">
<h2>Truth</h2>
<p class="p2">If you ask a question and the subject looks to the opposite side of their 
writing hand when they respond, they are in the creative mode. They are making 
something up. Ask the subject something you and they know to be fact and observe 
their body language when they respond with the truth. Mark this behavior in your 
memory and use it to judge all further responses. 
To extract information from the target, simply ask a question and remain 
silent and attentive until they say everything there is to know about it. Stare 
directly between their eyes.</p></div>

<h1>Divination</h1>
<p>Divination is the art using magickian's tools to enhance precognition. 
Choose a system of divination that appeals to you. Culture plays an important 
part in choosing a system. One or more divination tools can provide the same 
insights from a different perspective. 
</p><h3>The Word Association Game</h3><p class="p3">Play this game with a friend who shares your 
interest in magick. State that the intent of this game is to perceive the 
future. Say a word and the subject will respond with the first word that they 
can think of. Before you play, make the suggestion that the word in response has 
something to do with the future. Then switch rolls so that you respond to the 
subject's word. 
</p><h3>The Visualization Game</h3>
<p class="p3">This is a similar game. State that the subject sees 
a door. The door is closed with a sign that says; "Enter the future." Tell the 
subject to walk through the door after you pose your question. The subject will 
then relate what they imagine to be behind that door. 
</p><h3>The Telepathy Game</h3>
<p class="p3">Play the Visualization Game. Only state that behind the 
door is a representation of you. In your fist is a hidden representation of what 
you are thinking. Tell the subject to open the door and open your fist to reveal 
the symbol of that which is on your mind. 
</p><h3>Astrology</h3>
<p class="p3">This is the art of interpreting the positions of the stars to 
determine information about the past, present, and future. A horoscope is 
information about the positions of the stars during the time of the subject's 
birth which tells us something about the subject's character and future. 
The most valuable horoscopes are the ones we cast ourselves and for each other. 
Astrology is the tool. It is a way to mark time in prophecy, and a way to 
categorize events. Astrology is a way to categorize everything. As far as 
divination, the power is in the person who uses the tool of Astrology.

<h2>Divination Props</h2>
<p class="p2"></p><h3>Magick Mirrors</h3>
<p class="p3">Find a bowl used for the sole purpose of looking into the 
astral world. Go to the store and buy some black or navy blue food dye. Put water 
into the bowl and darken it with the food coloring. 
Sit in front of the bowl and hang your head over it. Stare at the outline of 
the bowl and focus on the point between your eyes. Keep your eyes open and rest 
yourself. Chant; "Mirror, Mirror, of the sea, show the naked world to me." Say 
it over and over. Stop when you feel you are day dreaming. 
You will see a transparent glow around the bowel extending 2cm. Now it will 
seem as if someone is waving a flashlight into your eyes. You will see pulsing 
flashes. Continue focusing between your eyes. You'll feel pressure there. Now 
focus upon the event in the past, present, or future as reflected in the 
astral world. 
</p><h3>Tarot Cards</h3>
<p class="p3">These are similar to playing cards. Like Astrology, these 
cards serve as a good tool to organize everything. Each card is like a page from 
a book which contains symbols which represent a universal teaching. When a card 
is randomly drawn from the deck with a question in mind, this teaching answers 
that question. </p></div>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<h2>Ancestors</h2>
<p class="p2">The ghosts of our past lives and the past lives of others 
that influence us in decision making are called ancestors. In the 
physical sense, when we die, we do not experience anything after that. 
But in the world of the collective subconscious we sleep. If the living 
think of us, then we have a ghostly consciousness. And those of us with a
 strong desire can waken ourselves to perceive the world of the living 
after we die. We have a desire to honor and respect friends and family 
that have 
passed on. This is an aspect of this magickal practice and religion. 
This is the honor of our ancestor's wisdom which can help us with our 
lives and remembering the good things they did in life. 
</p><h2>Death</h2>
<p class="p2">The name of the game of life is survival. Death challenges
 us to resist as long as possible and survive long enough to breed. 
Health and safety is one way we combat death. Awareness is immortal. 
When a being dies, the memory and awareness is transferred to a new 
tangible form, eventually. This is the cycle of reincarnation. The 
purpose of reincarnation is to collect wisdom for improving the living 
conditions of the body that is occupied, and for improving civilization 
with the wisdom gathered in past lives. 
</p><h2>Enlightenment</h2>
<p class="p2">The Tao leads to the improvement of your spirit over 
several lifetimes by helping your current soul become smarter, more 
powerful, yet compassionate toward others at the same time. Each soul 
has free will and makes wise or unwise choices in life. Karma is a way 
to judge one's progression as a living being. Bodhisattva's are people 
who have connected their current soul with their past life spirits and 
have achieved a level of understanding where their personal power allows
 them to live well and help others arround them to live well. This 
enlightenment is not a permanent condition. If a Bodhisattva's mind 
should be weakened by random natural conditions, then karma dictates the
 cold law of judgement. 
</p><h2>Evil</h2>
<p class="p2">Evil is the birth pain of an evolving universe. Evil is 
defined as that which is detrimental to the progress of the self and 
one's social group. No creature is entirely evil. There is no arch-fiend
 called Satan. There are no demons or devils. There are only confused 
spirits and the personifications of illnesses and social problems. 
Everything contains something that will help us to be happy. Evil people
 and unfortunate events can teach us to become wiser and stronger and 
thus benefit us. We think we are individuals because we are 
self-conscious. But we are also part of the collective consciousness of 
the universe. What we do affects everything and everything done affects 
us. If any being such as an angel or demon from the Christian Mythos is 
encountered in the astral world, it is a creation of incarnate and 
dis-incarnate Christian thinking. Only in this sense are angels and 
demons real spiritual beings.
</p><h2>Gods</h2>
<p class="p2">These are dream characters. They might represent 
collective, social, and abstract forces in the world. Some of these 
beings may coorespond to actual intelligences within nature. 
</p><h2>Heaven and Hell</h2>
<p class="p2">There is the world of reality and the world of dreams. 
Within both, is everyone's personal heaven and hell. When a being dies 
they lose physical consciousness but their astral and dream 
consciousness remains. Hell to one person may be heaven to another. Our 
concept of what is blissful and what hurts is relative to our 
inclinations and our upbringing. The Universe is symbolized by a 
mythical animal called the dragon. Primarily the dragon is symbolized by
 the heavenly circle called the Zodiac representing the exterior 
mysterious aspects of the dragon and internal natural elements 
representing the physics and what is known about the dragon. Being happy
 means making our dreams come true. We pull in the unknown aspects of 
the dragon from the heavens above and hell below. We coordinate these 
forces within the elements which surround us. Finally we bring the force
 of beneficial change and improvement into us. We are reminded that we 
are an aspect of the dragon and that we deserve to be happy. This is the
 foundation of the religions of Wicca in the west and Shinto in the 
east.
</p><h2>Humanity</h2>
<p class="p2">Humans are basically neutral. They will take the path of 
least resistance unless motivated to evolve. Evolution is a personal 
decision. Psychic talents are latent. With practice, these talents 
improve in everyone. But not everyone will evolve. Only those who are 
unsatisfied with their lives and want more will transform. Challenges in
 life are good. We are born in to this world under a series of fortunate
 or unfortunate circumstances. None of us asked to be born and knew 
nothing before we were first able to form memories. We are born into 
this world wondering why we are here and how can we be happy. Some of us
 are born with assets that help us in life and others are born with 
things that hinder us. Life itself is a gift though it can be cruel and 
generous. We must do our best to hold onto life and seek happiness. The 
wise among us can be found and can teach us things that will help us. 
The old who have found a way to keep living have much to say. 
</p><h2>Life</h2>
<p class="p2">We are here to evolve and take pleasure in living better 
lives. Our love for each other is the greatest bliss. We will live our 
lives and hopefully enjoy ourselves, each other, and make a worthy 
contribution to our social group before we die. We are all working for 
ultimate organization and mastery over nature and the increase of 
safety. We are working toward exploring the sea, the universe, as well 
as every area of life. We constantly seek for ourselves and loved ones 
purity, health, freedom and happiness until death. We must know 
ourselves. We must know of our capabilities and with that seek 
independence and autonomy. It is best to be free to choose the life we 
are to lead. So freedom is of primary importance to us. 
</p><h2>Luck</h2>
<p class="p2">Luck can be skill. People control nature and supply 
destiny to their futures. They also influence each other's future. 
Nature is a living creature that has an intelligent plan for us. In our 
view, luck may seem random, but it isn't. Bad luck forces us to adapt 
and improve. Good luck is our reward for improved skill. The darkness 
and light interact to shape us well. 
</p><h2>Mysticism</h2>
<p class="p2">We seek to emphasize the spiritual world but do not 
consider the ultimate outcome of enlightenment to be the absence of our 
bodies and dense matter. Solidity isn't evil. The basic bodily functions
 are not evil. Our form of mysticism seeks to unite the soul and the 
spirit to the flesh working together to improve ourselves in all worlds.
 We do not deny the pleasure of our bodies to please our souls. And we 
do not deny the contemplation of the soul for the exclusive indulgence 
of base desires. We are of all worlds and levels of awareness. 
</p><h2>Reincarnation</h2>
<p class="p2">Learn to think long term. Short term mistakes will reap 
consequences in the next life if not this one. Reincarnation, like death
 is a mechanism of evolution. The human population builds new and better
 humans. Bodies die so the soul can live in a body which is better 
suited to live in the modern world. One dynamic thing about living life 
after life is our improvement of technology. People are not born into a 
cast system because of what they have done in their past lives. We must 
focus on improving our station in life in the present and in the future.
 We must try to do this in each lifetime. We must try to be better than 
we were before. Reincarnation is also not an endorsement for suicide as 
those who do so are resisting the law of survival and are going against 
the universal will that they try to live as long as they can. 
</p><h2>Religion</h2>
<p class="p2">I believe in something because it empowers me to live a 
better life. I look at the results of my beliefs and judge my progress 
based upon the review. One should decide what they believe and not let 
others decide for them. God/dess speaks to everyone and God/dess is in 
everyone. We are all the chosen ones and each one of us rules by divine 
right. Religion attempts to explain why we are here and what we should 
do. But religion should not be an excuse to let someone or some group 
guide you through life and think for you. Religion should be a way to 
gather and organize in order to provide charity for the unfortunate and 
help them become self-supporting, strong, and ultimately free and 
autonomous. No religion should preach murder and mass destruction. We 
should do our best to live in peace with everyone by being strong and 
free. We should be mutually detering each other. 
</p><h2>Spirits</h2>
<p class="p2">These are disincarnate beings. They don't have physical 
flesh but have an astral and dream reflection of the body that they once
 possessed before they died. Spirits are in "jail." That is, for some 
reason they have been confined to the astral dream world and are unable 
to reincarnate into a new physical form. It is most likely an unfinished
 mission which requires the memories of their current soul when they 
were alive. When spirits go into the light, it deeply buries past life 
memories when reincarnating. A ghost is often synonymous with spirit, 
but technically a ghost is like an echoed memory of the person that once
 lived which lacks any strong spiritual consciousness.
</p><p class="p2">Spirits are linked to the place where they died and 
can appear as a thick foggy substance called ectoplasm likened to a star
 nebula. Flashes of light, or glowing star orbs, appearing in this 
spiritual nebula represent their individual consciousness and 
self-awareness. Rays of light and rods appearing represent their 
influence in the world of the living. Finally, they often take 
ectoplasmic shape as gray shadows in your peripheral vision. Ancient 
spirits can appear green or blue and have mirror or water reflective 
qualities. Younger spirits often have 2 dimensional photograph or video 
clip qualities. There are so many spirits that manifest every minute of 
your day that you often block-out and ignore this. Unlike ghosts, 
spirits can travel anywhere. Confused spirits can cause a lot of 
trouble, and guardian spirits often protect you from them.
</p><h2>Worship</h2>
<p class="p2">Worship is the act of modeling after more successful 
people to improve the self. It is also communicating with the 
subconscious to benefit daily life. Worship is a way to place value upon
 the life giving qualities that we call God/dess and increase God/dess 
our lives.

<h1>Japanese Magick</h1>
<h2>Ku-Ji-In</h2>
<p>Ku-Ji-In means "9 Syllable Seals" and it is an ancient Buddhist system
of magick originating in India, handed to the Chinese, and by way of
immigration, to the Japanese. Not really immigration, more like exile,
banishment, and outright escape by highly rebellious and imaginative
Chinese and Korean ex-patriots to Japan. 

</p><h3>Connection</h3>
<p class="p3">1 Fold your hands and extend your middle fingers and index
 fingers. Focus your attention on the base of your spine and imagine a 
lightning bolt shooting up your spine over the top of your head and 
striking down to your upper teeth.

</p><h3>Direction</h3>
<p class="p3">2 Fold your hands and extend your middle fingers and index
 fingers. Fold your middle fingers over your index fingers. Focus your 
attention on your genitals and imagine a lighting bolt shooting up to 
your lower teeth.

</p><h3>Premonition</h3>
<p class="p3">3 Fold your hands with your fingers on the outside. Focus 
on your belly button and imagine a lightning bolt shoot around your 
waist to your belly button again.

</p><h3>Healing</h3>
<p class="p3">4 Press your hands together and extend your fingers in the
 prayer pose. Focus on your heart and send a lighting bolt down your 
left arm to your right arm back to your heart and keep rotating the 
lighting bolt clockwise.

</p><h3>Harming</h3>
<p class="p3">4.5 or 9 Press your hands together and extend your fingers
 in the prayer pose but fold down your ring and middle fingers to form 
horns with your extended index and little fingers. 

</p><h3>Telepathy</h3>
<p class="p3">5 Fold your hands with your fingers on the inside. Focus 
on your throat and send two bolts of lightning up and over both of your 
ears, down the sides of your body to the outside of your feet ending at 
the bottoms of your feet.

</p><h3>Control</h3>
<p class="p3">6 Extend the index finger of your left hand. Grasp it with
 your right hand and press your right thumb into the fingernail of your 
left hand. Focus a little above and between your eyes and imagine a 
lighting bolt descending from there through the center of your body and 
split it
into two bolts down the insides of your legs to the bottoms of your 
feet.

</p><h3>Kenesis</h3>
<p class="p3">7 Splay your hands outward and press your index fingers 
and press your thumbs together to form a ring. Focus on the top of your 
head and imagine a lighting bolt coming from
the sky into your body. 

</p><h3>Protection</h3>
<p class="p3">8 Make a fist with your left hand and cover it with your 
right hand. Focus on an electrical ball of force surrounding and 
enveloping your body.

</p><h2>Ku-Ji-Kiri</h2>
<p class="p2">Ku-Ji-Kiri means "The Nine Syllable Cuts". Basically you 
imagine sending a lighting bolt out of your folded hands in the form of a
 sword-like brush.

</p><p class="p2">Each Ku-Ji-In is associated with a Japanese syllable 
Kanji character. Form the Ku-Ji-In and say the associated Japanese 
syllable. Slash the associated Kanji in the air correctly according to 
traditional Sho-Dou "The Way of the Writing Brush".

</p><h2>Fu Ka Sui Do</h2>
<p class="p2">You can use somatic gestures to direct Air, Fire, Water and Earth.

</p><p class="p2">Put your palm on your solar plexus. Your index finger points to your
lungs which represent air. Your middle finger is centered on your
solar plexus representing fire. Your ring finger points to your
intestines which use fluids to move and filter your food. Your little
finger points toward your thighs which are responsible for your earth
like stability.

</p><h3>Air</h3>
<p class="p3">Hold up your hand and press your index finger to your thumb. Breathe
in energy through the top of your head down into the circle your hand
made. Feel a warm energy collect there as you breathe out.

</p><h3>Fire</h3>
<p class="p3">Hold up your hand and press your middle finger to your thumb. Breathe
in energy through the top of your head down into the circle your hand

<h1>Ren's Alt.Religion.Wicca.FAQ Notes</h1>
 <div class="columns">
<p class="p2">
&gt; 1 Introductions - These Wiccan FAQ notes represent my view of Wicca only.
</p><p class="p2">
</p><h2>Alt.Religion.Wicca</h2>
<p class="p2">Conceived as early as 1989 when I was working with Reuters News
Service in Germany, I saw USENET and newsgroups as a means to share,
socialize, and cultivate Pagan culture in the world. Alt.Magick 1991,
Alt.Pagan 1993, and finally Alt.Religion.Wicca in 1994. We worked
together to propagate these newsgroups all across the world. We should
all thank members of Alt.Slack, Alt.Discordia and other joke-religion
newsgroups for their help in propagating Alt.Religion.Wicca. From the
Chaos, order was formed.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  1.1) What is this group for?
</p><p class="p2">
This is an un-moderated newsgroup where anyone can talk about
anything. The main subject is the religion of Wicca. But you are not
required to be a Wiccan to post here. Many Pagans of different Pagan
faiths post here. Another subject is "Magick". We share our craft (the
art of changing reality to suit us) and debate about it.
</p><p class="p2">
</p><h2>Wicca</h2>
<p class="p2">Gerald Gardner and Doreen Valiente are the main architects of Wicca in
England. Raymond Buckland introduced Wicca to the U.S. Janet Farrar
among many other authors and organizers are also to be thanked.
Vivianne Crowley wrote a book called "Wicca The Old Religion in the
New Age". This book provides a good summary of what the religion of
Wicca is.
</p><p class="p2">
http://www.amazon.com/Wicca-Old-Religion-New-Millennium/dp/0722532717
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  1.2) What is Wicca and how is it related to Paganism?
</p><p class="p2">
Paganism is the religious movement which stemmed from the Romantic
cultural movement in England. At that time, a lot of natural land was
being destroyed as the population began to expand. Romantic writers,
artists and thinkers began to romanticize the virtues of nature
untouched by human hands. Margaret Murray wrote a romanticized 
historical book about witches before the coming of Christianity and this
 lead to the Neo-Pagan movement. Neo-Paganism is a religious movement 
which attempts to recreate Celtic and Teutonic religion before the 
influence of Christianity. It is a return to nature worship and the 
goddesses and gods within nature. 
</p><p class="p2">
Wicca was primarily the idea of English folklorist Gerald Gardner who 
also traveled the world to study many religions. He was a member of the 
O.T.O. Crowley's Thelema. In the 1920's as part of his initiation into a
 higher order of that Ceremonial Group, Gardner formulated Wicca. Wicca 
is Neo-Pagan along the lines of Margaret Murray's book and it is much 
more. Wicca also contains a lot of English Folklore, Italian Strega 
Witchcraft and Ceremonial Magickal Thelema. Wicca started as an adult 
fertility religious expression of free love and  nudism in the 1960's. 
But modern prime time Wiccan Gatherings have evolved into a more family 
oriented fully clothed outdoor religious experience.
</p><p class="p2">
Many Wiccans today call themselve Eclectic Wiccans because they enjoy 
mixing many different religions, ceremonial magickal practices and 
folklore from around the world just as Gerald did. Some Eclectic Wiccans
 such as myself encorporate useful practices from around the world into a
 Western European cosmos. For example, Italian Diana may also have 
aspects of Egyptian Isis. Yet it is only under the name of Diana that 
all rituals are dedicated.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.1 What are some common, basic beliefs in Wicca?
</p><p class="p2">
Nature is divine and deserves our protection. The divine may be found
in everything. Masculine and Feminine aspects of the divine are
equally divine which means neither males nor females lead Wicca. We
work together as a team.
</p><p class="p2">
The body and natural functions of the body is not evil to be escaped.
Wiccans mystically seek to unite the higher goals of the spirit with
the lower needs of the body in a healthy balance.
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccans believe that every human being is a Goddess and God. Psychic
power and magick is encouraged and cultivated. The Gods of Wicca do
not answer prayers as servants. The Gods of Wicca work with Wiccans as partners in
magick which is changing reality for the better.
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccans do not believe that any one person is completely evil. We do
not believe in Satan. Nor do we believe in demonizing our enemies.
Everyone is capable of good.
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccans do not worship any one person. There is no king and queen of
the Wiccans. All of us are democratic. Leaders are often the most
worked servants.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.2 What god(desse)s do Wiccans worship?
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccans worship any Goddess or God from any mythology that reverences
life and nature. Our Goddesses and Gods have 800 and 1 names. That
means that all Goddesses and Gods are welcome into the Wiccan pantheon
including your god.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.3 What tools and rituals do you use?
</p><p class="p2">
Because Wicca is often a family magickal tradition these days, more
and more Wiccans are using wands rather than athame ritual knives
during Wiccan Gatherings. The wand represents the magickal will of the
Wiccan in shaping reality. In much the same way that a conductor
directs an orchestra, Wiccans direct hidden forces.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.4 Is there a set liturgy or liturgical calendar?
</p><p class="p2">
There are many holy days. The most important are;
In 2009
</p><p class="p2">March 20th - The Spring Equinox (Similar to Easter)
</p><p class="p2">June 21st - The Summer Solstice (Similar to a U.S. High School Bon-
Fire Festival)
</p><p class="p2">September 22nd - The Fall Equinox (Similar to Halloween and
Thanksgiving)
</p><p class="p2">December 21st - The Winter Solstice (Similar to Christmas)
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccan Rites of Passage
</p><p class="p2">
Birthing
</p><p class="p2">Similar to a Baby Shower and its modern practices. Coven members are
recognized as future mothers and fathers. The growing child is
blessed.
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccaning
</p><p class="p2">The child's name is called out and the child is introduced to the Gods
and to the coven. The child is not committed to Wicca and is free to
chose his or her own religious path. The child is given magickal
protection.
</p><p class="p2">
Coming of Age
</p><p class="p2">Similar to a High School graduation party with all its modern
practices. Non-Wiccan graduating teens are not required to attend. The
Wiccan parents are congratulated for their son's or daughter's
survival. Once again, protection is asked for.
</p><p class="p2">
Handfasting
</p><p class="p2">A Wiccan ceremony to commemorate and recognize a civil marriage. This
is literally tying the knot. Wiccans and their Wiccan or non-Wiccan
spouses are required to attend.
</p><p class="p2">
Handparting
</p><p class="p2">A Wiccan recognition of a legal divorce. This does not have to be
announced publicly to the coven but coven members need to know as to
clear up any misunderstandings or gossip.

</p><p class="p2">Active Duty
</p><p class="p2">A ceremony in which the participating Wiccan or Non-Wiccan soldier
going to war is given magickal protection.

</p><p class="p2">Eldering
</p><p class="p2">Similar to a job retirement party and its modern practices. When a
coven member retires from work, a formal Wiccan ceremony is wanted to
celebrate years of endurance.

</p><p class="p2">Crossing Rebirth
</p><p class="p2">Similar to a funeral with its modern practice. Cremation is popular. 
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.5 What is basic Wiccan theology?
</p><p class="p2">
Pantheism. That is the idea that the divine is in all things. One of
the most important myths within Wicca is the story of the rebirth of
the God. It explains our holy days, the nature of our Gods and our
beliefs about life and death.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  2.6 What are Wiccan ethics, the "Wiccan Rede" and "three-fold law?"
</p><p class="p2">
The Rede is a guide. It really isn't a law. Any Wiccan can do what
they want. We are encouraged to consider the consequences of our
actions. Since people are likely to treat you the way you treat them,
it is best to treat them with respect and fairness.
</p><p class="p2">
"Do what you want. Consider the greater good."
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.1 Can I be a Christian/ Jew/ Muslim/ Buddhist/ Taoist/ Astrologer/
&gt; Druid/ Shaman/omnivore/ whatever and a Wiccan?
</p><p class="p2">
Wicca is an eclectic religion which means any Wiccan may also be a
Taoist, Druid, and whatever. Wiccans are not required to give up
another religion in order to be a Wiccan. But it is other religions
such as Christianity which require that their members be part of no
other religion. So if you are a Christian, you are required by them,
not to be a Wiccan.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.2 What are "dedication" and "initiation" in Wicca?
</p><p class="p2">
You can start right now dedicating yourself to our
religion of Wicca. First, read about Wicca extensively. If you have a
feeling as if you have "come home", then follow your intuition and
join us. There are several online and offline source materials for a
self-dedication ritual. It is recommended by many that you study Wicca 
for a year and a day before dedicating yourself to Wicca. At that time, 
when your dedication to Wicca becomes stronger, you may call yourself a 
Wiccan Priest or Wiccan Priestess. 
</p><p class="p2">
If you wish to join a Wiccan coven, start by attending Wiccan
gatherings. Ask around for good reports about the coven. Spend a lot
of time with them and find out everything you can about their public
and private practices. If you enjoy their company and feel relaxed --
if you have gotten to know them -- then undergo their coven initiation
ritual. Never do anything you don't want to do. If anyone badgers or
forces you, make yourself clear. There are many covens today to chose
from. Consult http://www.witchvox.com/
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.3 Do all Wiccans practice magic/k?
</p><p class="p2">
Wicca is a Magickal religion. We are all Goddesses and Gods as daughters
 and sons of the Pantheons of Gods. Wiccans do not just pray, we assist 
our Gods in casting to make our world better.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.4 Is Wicca the same thing as witchcraft?
</p><p class="p2">
Please see Principle #7.
</p><p class="p2">
13 Principles of Belief by The Council of American Witches
</p><p class="p2">
7. Calling oneself "Witch" does not make a Witch - but neither does
heredity itself, or the collecting of titles, degrees, and
initiations. A Witch seeks to control the forces within him/herself
that make life possible in order to live wisely and well, without harm
to others, and in harmony with Nature.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.5 What were "the Burning Times?"
</p><p class="p2">
The thought that millions of people of old folklore beliefs were burned 
at the stake is a myth really. It is true that some folk practitioners 
were executed. But most historical accounts about religious wars during 
the dark and middle ages were about Christians executing other 
Christians not of their denomination.
There was a strong movement by emerging male doctors
to dismiss the power of the midwives during the rise of Christianity
in Europe. But most actual believers in the Old Religion converted
with their rulers and attended church every Sunday as good little
Christians. They practiced their folk craft in secret. During the 
Inquisition, many
could no longer keep their practices secret and as a result there was
a mass exodus to Ireland where there was no Inquisition. Most
believers in the old religions and folk practices were wise enough to
fake being Christian. "Mother Mary" herself has mostly assumed the
imagery, rituals and other practices in observing the Goddess in
Europe.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.8 What is the "Book of Shadows?"  Where do I get one?
</p><p class="p2">
The Book of Shadows is your personal electronic or paper journal of
your beliefs, rituals, and notes about your Wiccan journey toward self-
improvement. You're the writer and editor. It is named "The Book of
Shadows" because it is to remain hidden from everyone but yourself and
those you trust with the knowledge you have acquired.
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.9 What is a coven and how do I join one?
</p><p class="p2">
Witchvox
</p><p class="p2">
I mentioned how many practitioners in Europe fled to Ireland to escape
the Inquisition. The ones that didn't go to Ireland had to come up
with a strict structure in order to keep their practices secret.
</p><p class="p2">
Here is one of many structures that has been handed down to me. It
isn't needed anymore but we should be reminded of it if there should
ever be another Inquisition.
</p><p class="p2">
Worshipers of the Goddess and God in defiance of the Conqueror's God
should meet in a secret circle. 6 females, 6 males, for a total of 6
couples. One for each sign of the Zodiac. 1 member from another coven
may observe secret meetings called Esbats. She or he is the 13th
member and acts as the liaison between 2 covens. Members are to call
each other to meetings wearing a red garter with the "modified"
Christian cross.
</p><p class="p2">
If any member of the coven should expose or confess the members of his
or her coven, let him be branded or slashed on the face to mark him or
her a warlock. Banish him or her from the coven and inform the other
covens through the liaisons that he or she is not welcome for
disregarding his or her initiation vows. (Obviously you wouldn't slash
or brand someone today.)
</p><p class="p2">
&gt;  3.10 How do I witness about Jesus Christ to a Wiccan?
</p><p class="p2">
Do it the best you can. Wicca welcomes any and all debate about Wicca.
We welcome all comparison with other religions. Alt.Religion.Wicca
does not welcome the flooding of our newsgroup with meaningless cut-
and-pasted posts. Nor do we welcome physical threats.
</p><p class="p2">
Why Wicca is not a Cult
</p><p class="p2"> 
Steve Alan's informative information.
http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/help/someoneelse/concern.htm
</p><p class="p2">
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not encourage people to drop out of school.
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not encourage people to quit their jobs.
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not encourage people to break off relationships.
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not ask their members to give a person or group all worldly
possessions.
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not ask their members to work up to 16 hours or more for
them every day.

</p><p class="p2">All of these requirements force members to become painfully dependent on their group or one person.
</p><p class="p2">
Wiccans don't all wear the same religious uniform.
</p><p class="p2">Nor do we all wear our hair in the same way.
</p><p class="p2">Nor are we asked to eat diets that keep us slightly hungry and dazed.

</p><p class="p2">Wiccans do not exhibit the warning signs of a programed follower.
</p><p class="p2">We remain humorous.
</p><p class="p2">We remain open and less defensive to each other.
</p><p class="p2">We often become less judgmental.
</p><p class="p2">Nor are we fanatical or proselytizing Wicca. We know that our religion
and way is not for everyone. We also know that our religious path
isn't the only way toward enlightenment and the divine.
</p><p class="p2">Wiccans often remain analytical and scientific yet open to the
possibilities of the magickal.</p></div>
