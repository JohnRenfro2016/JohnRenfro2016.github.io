MATH CONCEPTS

Natural Counting Numbers are 1, 2, 3, ...
Whole Numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, ....
Integers are ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
Rational Numbers are terminating and repeating decimal numbers, fractions and integers
..., -3, -2.5, -2, -1, 0, 1.5(1/2), ...

ADDING
the addend plus the addend equals the sum

stack multiple digit addends and add from right to left
adds up to 9, everything is fine
adds up to 10 or more, take the extra next door

the absolute value of a negative or positive number
is the number of units to zero
the absolute value of -3 is 3
the absolute value of 3 is 3

when adding like sign integers
add them
keep the sign
When adding different sign integers
stack the greater absolute value over the lesser absolute value
subtract them
keep the sign of the greater absolute value

when adding decimals
stack the addends
line up the decimals
pad with zeros
add normally
bring the decimal down to the sum

the Zero/Identity Property of Addition
says adding 0 to a sum does not change the sum

the Commutative Property of Addition
says you can add the addends in any order
and the sum remains the same

the Associative Property of Addition
says you can group addends in ( ) in any way
and the sum remains the same

the inverse operation of addition is subtraction

SUBTRACTING
the minuend minus the subtrahend equals the difference

stack the minuend over the subtrahend and subtract from right to left
more on the top, no need to stop
more on the floor, borrow 10 next door
numbers the same, zero's the game

when subtracting integers
change the minus sign to a plus sign
change the sign of the subtrahend to the opposite sign
add the integers

when subtracting decimals
stack the minuend over the subtrahend
line up the decimals
pad with zeros
subtract normally
bring down the decimal to the difference

the inverse operation of subtraction is addition

MULTIPLYING

the factor times the factor equals the product

multiplication is repeated addition
8 x 3 = 24
8 + 8 + 8 = 24

multiplying a factor by 2
is doubling the factor 2 x 6 = 6 + 6 = 12
multiplying a factor by 3
is doubling the factor and adding the factor 3 x 6 = (6 + 6) + 6 = 18
multiplying a factor by 4
is doubling the factor and then doubling the product 4 x 6 = (6 + 6) = (12 + 12) = 24
multiplying a factor by 5
is counting the factor by 5s 5 x 6 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
multiplying a factor by 6
is counting the factor by 5s and adding a factor 6 x 6 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 + 6 = 36

M.any Z.oos M.any A.nimals
stack two factors over each other
M.ultiply the tens digit of the second factor to the tens digit of the first factor
multiply the tens digit of the second factor to the hundreds digit of the first factor
make a line and put the product under the line
under the product on the right side under the tens digit of the product put a Z.ero
M.ultiply the hundreds digit of the second factor to the tens digit of the first factor
multiply the hundreds digit of the second factor to the hundreds digit of the first factor
make a line and A.dd the two products together from right to left
make a double line under the sum of the products

multiply same sign integers
the product is always positive
multiply different sign integers
the product is always negative

multiplying decimals
multiply normally
count the decimal places from right to left of both factors
add the decimal places
in the product from right to left, place the decimal that many places

the Zero Property of Multiplication
says that a factor times 0 is 0

the Identity Property of Multiplication
says that a factor times 1 is that factor

the Commutative Property of Multiplication
says that multiplying the factors in any order results in the same product

the Associative Property of Multiplication 
says that grouping the factors in any order ( ) results in the same product
